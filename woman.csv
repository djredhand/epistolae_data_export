"115","Hildegard of Bingen","Magistra of St. Rupert's","Born the tenth child of a noble couple (Hildebert and Mechtild) from Bermersheim in the Rhineland,  Hildegard was destined for the religious life from chldhood.  She was enclosed with a religious noblewoman, Jutta of Sponheim, a recluse,  perhaps when she was eight, and she took vows in the monastery of St. Disibod with Jutta in 1112, when she was 14, along with other girls attached to Jutta.   Jutta presumably taught Hildegard to read the psalter.   Hildegard never had a formal Latin education, and relied on her various secretaries to edit her grammar, but she seems to have read widely through her life.  
Hildegard was best known in her time for her prophetic visions, which she seems to have had from early on, which she did not reveal except to Jutta and later to the monk who would be her secretary as well as her friend, Volmar, when God commanded her to write her visions.  With the help and support of Volmar and one of her nuns, Richardis of Stade, to whom Hildegard was deeply attached, and with the permission of the abbot of St. Disibod, Kuno, Hildegard began to commit her visions to writing in her forties.  She began with the Scivias, brilliantly illustrated under her direction.  Before she published it, however, it was approved by a papal commission named by pope Eugene III, at the instigation of her archbishop, Henry of Mainz, and with the apparent support of Bernard of Clairvaux whom she had met and to whom she had writtenfor advice.   As Hildegard’s reputation grew and the number of pilgrims to St. Disibod increased, Hildegard felt more constrained and in 1148 she had a vision that commanded her to move with her nuns (and their dowries) to a new location.    Despite abbot Kuno’s resistance  --Hildegard’s presence gave his monastery much pretige -- and wariness on the part of the nuns and their families, Hildegard, with the help of a serendipitous illness, had her way,  and established a new house at Rupertsberg.  
At Rupertsberg, Hildegard cared for the sick, studied their illnesses and wrote two  medical works,  one 
theoretical, known as the Causes and Cures, the other more practical, the  Physica,  which suggests  
remedies.   She also  composed religious poems and music, a play, the Ordo virtutum,  two other 
volumes of visions,  the Liber vitae meritorum (the Book of Life’s Merits) and the Liber diivinorum 
 operum, (the Book of Divine Works), and a life of St. Rupert.   She had a series of secretaries and 
helpers, beginning with the nun Richardis of Stade and the monk Volmar, then Ludwig abbot of St. Eucharius, her nephew Wescelin, Godfrey of Disibodenberg, Volmar’s successor as provost of Rupertsberg, her brother Hugo of Tholey, and finally Guibert of Gembloux.  Godfrey (with Theodoric of Echternach) and Guibert (in a long letter wrote lives of Hildegard.  The main function of the secretaries was to edit Hildegard’s Latin, since she had not been formally trained in the language, but she was adamant that they were not to change her words, since those came from God.  Indeed, at the end of the Book of Divine Works, she warns that no man should be so bold as to add to or delete anything without sinning against the Holy Spirit, which will not be forgiven here nor in the next world.  Only at the end of her life did she seem to grant Guibert a little more leeway in editing her life of St. Martin.

Hildegard also carried on an extensive correspondence with foreign dignitaries, religious and lay, and 
local people,  religious and lay.  The new edition of her letters numbers 390 (close to if not exactly the 
extant total).   It is based on collections made during her lifetime and apparently with her approval.  Her correspondents included popes, bishops and archbishops, abbots and abbesses, nuns and monks and priests, kings and queens, an emperor, noblewomen and noblemen, laywomen and 
 laymen.  People wrote asking not only her advice but her prophecies of the future, which were widely respected:  Frederick Barbarossa said that what she had predicted in his presence “we now have in hand,” ep.314;  John of Salisbury wrote a friend saying that pope Eugene III wanted to consult Hildegard’s prophecies because what she had so far predicted about his reign had been right (The Letters of John of Salisbury, ed. Millor, Butler, and Brooke), ep.185.

In her letters Hildegard plays many roles:  as the voice of God, the instrument by which God addressed and admonished mankind and the church, admonishing popes and bishops to fight injustice and corruption; as a mediator with the divine, carrying God’s  message to humankind and individuals’ prayers back to God; as a mediator among humans, particularly in the monastic world, between abbesses and their nuns or abbots and their monks, telling those who want to give up their responsibilities to carry the burden they took on, but at the same time urging their flocks to behave better; as a source of knowledge and wisdom, theological, prophetic,moral, and practical, both legal and medical; as a crusader for what she believed in (and/or believed God wanted), like her assertion of her right to bury a previously excommunicated but repentant nobleman in the monastery grounds; and as a woman who inspired both awe and affection in the women and men who knew and worked with her.  She deals sternly with those in power and sympathetically with those in distress.  She preaches mercy as well as justice, love rather than fear, compassion rather than anger, moderation rather than fanaticism, and always a strong sense of responsibility.  Her advice is often practical, though her style is usually rich with parables and striking imagery.  On occasion she used letters to powerful people to try to get her way, as in her unsuccessful attempt to keep Richardis with her, through letters to a pope (Eugene III), two archbishops and a marchioness, and her successful insistence on the right of her convent to a provost of their choice from Disibodenberg, who would also serve as her secretary, which she again took to the pope (Alexander III).1
She is perhaps the most important medieval woman correspondent in terms of the extent and range of her correspondence,  but since her letters have recently been published and translated, most of them are not included here.2  The translations can be found online through Oxford Scholarship Online. http://www.oxfordscholarship.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/oso/public/content/religion/9780195168372/toc.html

"103","Angelberga of Italy","Queen of Italy, Empress","From the powerful Supponide clan of Parma, Angelberga married Louis II in or about 851.  Louis was the son of Lothar I, who had been given Italy in the partition among the sons of Louis the Pious.  He succeeded to the empire in 855.  Angelberga was crowned empress by Nicholas I in 858.  They had two daughters, one, Ermengard, married Boso of Vienne, who became king of Provence .  Angelberga supported Louis’s brother, Lothar, in his attempts to divorce Theutberga; she negotiated on Lothar’s behalf with Charles the Bald and Louis the German.  Angelberga was active in politics as early as 871, ruling north Italy for her husband whil he fought Saracens in the south, sometimes accompanied him on campaigns, convoked and presided over an imperial congress in his palace in Ravenna, administered large possessions, presided at a tribunal to try an imperial envoy.  She was called “consors et adiutrix regni” the consort and helper/assistant of the kingdom.  Louis divorced her briefly in 872, possibly because of rumors of adultery – a story about her attempt to seduce a count Hucbald is told in the Epitome Chronicorum Casinensium, but there is no real evidence for it.  Her  attempts to influence Italian politics made her enemies and may have contributed to a revolt against her husband, who married a woman from the rebellious area of central Italy while he was divorced from Angelberga.  But she was not kept away for long.  She was Louis’s regent at Capua in 872, finished Louis’s campaign and brought back southern Italian hostages and relics in 874.  She was involved in charters and her name was on coins along with Louis’s.(1)  Louis made twelve grants of land to her and she left more than twenty manors to San Sixtus of Piacenza.
After Louis’s death in 875, she called a council at Pavia to decide the succession, and was later at the center of the faction opposing Charles the Bald.  Louis the German, Carloman, Charles the Fat, Berengar, and Arnulf all looked in turn for her support and confirmed her property.  Since she had no son, she had no formal political role and retired to San Sixtus, the  monastery in Piacenza which she had founded, but she continued to take a part in politics for many years, usually without success, but never ignored:  she probably supported her son-in-law, Boso, then tried to have her grandson Louis the Blind designated the successor of Charles the Fat, and she backed Berengar of Friuli against Guy of Spoleto.  None of these attempts was successful, but letters show that she was nonetheless called on by the pope, John VIII, and Louis the German, king of the East Franks, to negotiate for them although she had no official position.  The letters from John about worldly affairs indicate that she remained a trusted and potentially useful ally.
Angelberga’s role as advisor and her connections in Italy made the emperor and his brothers nervous.  Charles the Fat captured and imprisoned her in Zurzach in 880 and only released her when his claim on the imperial throne seemed secure.

"77","Blanche of Castile, queen of France","Queen of France","Blanche of Castile (1188-1252) was the daughter of the English princess Eleanor and Alfonso VIII, king of Castle.  Her mother was the daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II.  Her three sisters also became queens:  the two older sisters, Berengaria/Berenguela and Urraca, married Alfonso IX, king of Leon, and Alfonso II of Portugal; her younger sister, Eleanor, married James I of Aragon.  Blanche married Louis VIII of France in 1200; her grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, by then close to 80, went to Spain to fetch and escort her.  Blanche’s dowry included Évreux, Issoudun and Graçay; her dower Hesdin, Bapaume, and Lens.1   \r\nLouis was only a year older and the marriage was not consummated until 1205.2 The children from their marriage were:  Philip (1209-1218), Louis IX (1214), Robert of Artois (1216), Jean (1219-27), Alphonse of Poitiers and Auvergne (1220), Philip-Dagobert (1222-35), Isabel (1224?), and Charles of Anjou (1226), who would become king of Sicily.3  Louis married Marguerite of Provence (who like her mother-in-law was one of four sister queens), Robert married Matilda of Brabant, Alphonse married Jeanne of Toulouse (daughter of Raymond VII), and Charles married first Beatrice of Provence, sister of Margaret and heir to Provence, died in 1268.\r\nWhile we do not have her letter on the subject, there is a record of a request from Blanche to pope Honorius III, asking his help for vows she knows she made during illnesses of her children but of which she has forgotten the substance.  The pope writes to the prior of St. Victor in Paris asking him to hear her confession and commute the vows into works of mercy (HGF 19.714, dated December 22, 1220), recorded in Regesta Honorii Papae III, ed. Sac. Petrus Pressutti, (Rome:  Vatican, 1888), 1.480, #2908.  Because Blanche’s mother was the only other surviving child of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Blanche had a claim to the throne of England when English barons rebelled against King John.  In 1216, with the support of the barons, Louis invaded England to make good his wife’s claim.  Blanche raised money from her father-in-law by threatening to put up her children as hostages (Sivéry, 62); she appealed to the barons and bourgeois of her lands in Artois to bring aid to her husband and raised troops for him, but they did not make it to the English shore (Pernoud, 111-12).  Nonetheless, Louis held much of south-east England, including London.  But when John died, the rebels went over to his young son Henry III and Louis made peace by the Treaty of Kingston, 1217, and withdrew.4  \r\nBlanche also had a claim to the throne of Castile.  When her brother Henry died, her sister Berengaria succeeded him and passed the throne to her son Ferdinand, who was considered illegitimate by some Castilians because his parents’ marriage was within forbidden degrees of consanguinity.  They would have preferred a son of Blanche, but she did not press that claim, a renunciation the poet Sordello held against her in his lament for Blacatz (lines 13-16).\r\nLouis’s father Philip died in July 1223, and Louis VIII and Blanche were crowned on August 6.  Louis himself died only three years later, leaving Blanche, by his will, in charge of the government and the kingdom.  In a contemporary chronicle, the Chronique rimée, Philippe Mousquet speaks of the unusually strong love between king and queen and their children.5    Louis IX was 12 when his father died and his mother served as regent during his minority, but she continued to participate in government long after, as reports addressed to her on the siege of Carcassonne and a conspiracy from La Rochelle make clear (see letters).\r\nBlanche took an active part in the affairs of the kingdom:  she went with French forces to meet the armies of the western barons allied with England, but instead of fighting them, she negotiated with Thibaut de Champagne and Henri de Bar, and arranged a number of marriages between the children of rebel barons and her own.  The marriages did not occur, however, the rebel army regrouped and when the young Louis, then 13, took refuge in the castle of Montlhéry and sent to his mother for help; she appealed to the people of Paris and the Ile de France, raised an army and set out but before she reached them, the barons disbanded.  She negotiated various reconciliations with her first cousin, Raymond of Toulouse, in 1229, 1233, and 1242, whose daughter and heir, Jeanne, married Blanche’s son Alphonse.  Blanche interfered successfully to stop a proposed marriage between the countess of Flanders, Joan, and Simon of Montfort, and instead arranged one between Joan and Thomas of Savoy, the uncle of Blanche’s daughter-in-law, Marguerite.\r\nNot everyone was happy with her administration.  Her enemies called her “Dame Hersent” (the wolf in the Roman de Renart); they accused her of improper relations with Thibaut of Champagne and with the papal legate, Romano Frangipani, during the troubles at the university of Paris, the usual charges leveled at women, particularly foreign women, in public life.6    But she took independent positions on many issues:  she protected the Jews, encouraging and on occasion even presiding over debates on the Talmud despite general anti-Semitism (Pernoud, 326-28, Sivéry, 198), and she refused to side with the papacy against the emperor Frederick II or support a crusade against his son Conrad; indeed, she confiscated the property of French vassals who joined that crusade.7    When all Blanche’s sons went on crusade with their wives, 1248-49, Blanche was again in charge at home though she had opposed the crusade.  When Raymond of Toulouse died, she sent envoys to take oathes of fidelity to her son, Alphonse, and daughter-in-law, Raymond’s daughter Jeanne, preventing an unfriendly takeover.  Unusually concerned with the plight of the poor, she rescued serfs from prison and from abuse by canons, heading the force that freed them in person (Pernoud, 353-4), and she freed many serfs before her death (Pernoud, 355).  \r\nBlanche was not supportive of Louis’s wife, Marguerite of Provence and was reported to have interfered as much as she could in their marriage.  But she gave alms generously to the poor and to the sick and lepers and she was an enthusiastic supporter of the Cistercian order.  She founded two abbeys, Notre-Dame-du-Lys (Sainte-Marie-Royale) near Melun and Notre-Dame-la-Royale at Maubuisson near Pontoise, where she was buried, having entered the house just before her death.  The Miroir de l’âme, a work by a Cistercian nun, was dedicated to her.8    \r\nMatthew Paris, the English Benedictine, gives Blanche, “queen and regent of the French,” a generally favorable press in the Chronica Majora, recognizing her stature in the kingdom.9    Matthew mentions the rumors of an affair between Blanche and a papal legate, but seems to discount them.  He makes much of her grief for her sons, suggesting it hastened her death, which he reports thus:  “ . . . died that lady of all ladies of this world, Blanche, the mother of the French king; the guardian, protectress, and queen of France ... Her death, a great loss and source of grief to the French, was prematurely brought on by manifold sorrows.”  Matthew says the death of her husband, Louis, left the French kingdom “dependent on her.”  He reports that she took the veil before she died and was buried with a crown over the veil and in her queen’s robes.  “Thus, therefore, did the noble lady Blanche, a woman in sex, but a man in counsels, one worthy to be compared with Semiramis, bid farewell to the world, leaving the French kingdom comfortless and void of all consolation.”10","1.Blanche ceded Issoudun and Graçay to her son Louis who gave her Crépy-en-Valois, La Ferté-Milon and Pierre-fonds instead; Hesdin, Bapaume, Lens, she ceded to her son Robert, in return for which she got Meulan, Pontoise, Étampes, Dourdan, Corbeil, and Melun.\r\nGérard Sivéry, Blanche de Castille (Paris:  Fayard, 1990), 88, notes that her husband had confirmed her dowery in an act of the royal chancellery in 1224 at her request, which he thinks suggests that she was already aware of opposition and protecting herself in case he died.\r\n\r\n2.According to Regine Pernoud, La Reine Blanche (Paris:  Albin Michel, 1972, 41.

"23","Agnes of Poitiers, empress","empress","Empress Agnes, who was regent of the empire for her son Henry IV from 1056-1062, was the daughter of William III of Poitiers and Agnes of Burgundy, and second wife (married in 1043) and widow of emperor Henry III (+1056).  She had five children born between 1045 and 1052:  Matilda (+1060), duchess of Swabia; Judith/Sophia, queen of Hungary and then of Poland; Adelaide, abbess of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim; emperor Henry IV (+1106); and Conrad (+1055).(!1)  Her husband died when his heir was 6 and Agnes was the regent until her son was kidnapped by Anno of Cologne, who then assumed the regency.  While she was regent, journeying through the kingdom to give judgments and holding Reichstagen, trying to continue her husband’s policies and act in the best interests of the empire, she made many enemies, particularly within the church, but when she retired to become a nun in Rome she won the respect and friendship of Peter Damian and pope Gregory VII whose reforms she supported.  Agnes was accompanied to Rome by her widowed sister-in-law Hermesinde, who also became a nun and corresponded with Peter Damian.  Agnes mediated between her son and the pope even after she became a nun, returning periodically to the imperial court for official business(!2) and to Poitiers to negotiate with her brother, William VI/VIII.  William was the father of the first extant Provençal poet, William VII/IX, himself the grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine, making Agnes the great-grand-aunt of Eleanor.
Though Agnes had supporters and admirers (e.g., Lambert, “all the work of administration was done by the empress, who defended the endangered common weal with such art that the novelty gave rise to no tumult, no dissension,” and “the empress sustained her son and the affairs of the realm by herself”(!3)), she also had hostile opponents.  Many of the criticisms directed at her during the regency were openly anti-feminist.  The Bamberg canons complained angrily to bishop Gunther of Bamberg that the empress had prevailed on him to give an abbacy back to an abbess whose misdeeds they list in some detail, culminating in the abbacy becoming a brothel.  They tell him “there may not be much glory in defeating a woman, but there is certainly great shame in being defeated by one” (MGH BZHIV, Briefs Meinhards von Bamberg, ep.61, p.107-09, dated 1060-61).  Gunther for his part complained to Anno of Köln that the empress attacks his opinion in his absence and cites him against himself (ep.68, p.115-16 late 1061).  Meinhard of Bamberg wrote sarcastically to Gunther congratulating him that his lady (Agnes) has taken him back into favor, with quotes from Terence and aspersions cast at her sex, her nature, her fatherland, and her mother, who had “as many marriages as birthdays” (ep.71, p.118-19, late 1062).(!4)  Dean Poppo, in a letter to Gunther, described the most hostile spirit of the empress (“infestissimus imperatricis animus”), who judges our harm small, your grace nothing (MGH BZHIV, Weitere Briefe Meinhards, ep.10, p.203-04, late 1062).  Years later, Bonizo of Sutri attacked Agnes for her role in appointing the anti-pope Cadalus in the Liber ad amicum, c.1085:  the Lombard bishops, he said, “seduced the soul of the empress, inasmuch as it was feminine . . . deceived by these and similar machinations, the empress, with feminine license, gave assent to a nefarious work.”(!5)  
Even Peter Damian, who had good relations with Agnes once she came to Rome, had also had differences with her while she was regent.  He had ignored her presence and role and insisted that the church must intervene in the empire because young Henry was “without a tutor,”(!6) and he had joined with or written for other cardinals, in an assertion of papal versus imperial rights of investiture, ep.71, see 3) below.  But once she left the regency, she won his respect for her religious devotion and his affection, as witnessed by the letters of praise, encouragement, and grief at her absence.

Eventually, he not only claimed that he had never known her physically but he also accused her of adultery with Bishop Liutward of Vercelli, his chancellor in 887, when he knew he was dying and was desperate to fix the succession.  Though she cleared herself of the charge through an ordeal of burning plowshares and a solemn declaration of virginity(1), she did accept the divorce and retire to a monastery in 887.  The monastery was Andlau which she had founded in 880 on her family lands; she also held the monastery of Zurzach, from Charles.  She died at Andlau between 894 and 896.

"22","Elisabeth of Schoenau","","Elisabeth was born into a family probably of the minor nobility which gave several members to the church, one great uncle a bishop, a brother and a nephew abbots, another brother a prior, female relatives nuns at Schönau and at Andernach, Elisabeth herself a magistra (the presiding nun in a combined monastery of men and women under the rule of an abbot) at Schönau.  Elisabeth entered the Benedictine double monastery at age 12 in 1157, and her brother Ekbert joined her there in about 1155 as her secretary, and after her death as abbot (from 1167).
Elisabeth began to have visions in 1152, a year after Hildegard of Bingen published her first book of visions, the Scivias, a work which seems to have influenced Elisabeth.  They exchanged some letters and Elisabeth visited Hildegard at Rupertsberg in 1156.  At first Elisabeth was reticent about her visions but, as she relates in a letter to Hildegard — 21) below — an angel insisted forcefully that she reveal them and preach penance, which she did at first through her abbot Hildelin.  After Ekbert came to Schönau, he collected and perhaps edited the visions in six books, and he may have directed her interest towards more theological questions.  The six books are three [unnamed] books of visions, “visionary diaries,” the Liber viarum dei (Book of the Ways of God), the Liber revelationum Elisabeth de sacro exercitu virginum Coloniensium (Book of the Revelations of Elisabeth about the Holy Army of the Virgins of Cologne) about Ursula and the 11,000 virgins, and the letters.  Elisabeth’s controversial Visio de resurrectione beate virginis Mariae (on the resurrection of the Virgin Mary) which had circulated on its own was eventually attached to the second book of visions.  Ekbert also added a description of her death (De Obitu).
Elisabeth’s visions were sought before and after the fact — some people sent her questions to be answered in visions, some read and copied the written versions, not only in her own part of Germany, but in France and England as well.(!1)
The sixth book, which contains most of the extant letters, includes an introductory explanation by Ekbert of how the letters came to be written:(!2)
 
From the diocese of Metz, from an abbey in Busendorf, a monk who was very learned in sacred letters came to visit Elisabeth and investigate what God was doing with her.  After he had heartily wished her joy and faithfully instructed her with good advice, when he was about to leave, he asked that he might be worthy at some point to receive a letter from her.  The letter was to be of that same grace from which she had in ecstasy pronounced other things, a letter from which his mind could glean some correction and good consolation.  At the same time he also asked that she send a letter advising his abbot and brothers about correcting their lives.  When Elisabeth had reverently commended this to divine grace, on the night after his request, while she was at Matins, suddenly and unexpectedly she announced the letter which that brother had requested to be sent to him.  Similarly, on the third night after this she announced the other letter which he had asked to be sent to his abbot and brothers.  From this time, she began to have the grace of announcing letters of the kind which are transcribed below.

At the same time he also asked that she send a letter advising his abbot and brothers about correcting their lives.  When Elisabeth had reverently commended this to divine grace, on the night after his request, while she was at Matins, suddenly and unexpectedly she announced the letter which that brother had requested to be sent to him.  Similarly, on the third night after this she announced the other letter which he had asked to be sent to his abbot and brothers.  From this time, she began to have the grace of announcing letters of the kind which are transcribed below.

"27","Matilda, empress, queen of the Romans","countess of Anjou, designated heir and “domina” of England","Empress Matilda, the daughter and only surviving child of Henry I and Matilda, was born after her father ascended the throne.(!1)  She was betrothed to the future Roman emperor, Henry V, and sent to his court when she was eight; they were married in 1114, after which she traveled with her husband, was included in official acts, and participated in his government and his travels.  When her husband had to return to Germany in 1118, he left her as regent in Italy with an army; though records of her regency are scant, they do include giving judgment in court proceedings (Chibnall, 33).  After the emperor’s death in 1125, she returned to England.  Her father obtained from the bishops and magnates present at his Christmas court, in January 1127, oaths of allegiance to Matilda if he died without male heir.  Henry married Matilda to Geoffrey of Anjou, ten years her junior, in 1127, apparently against her wishes.
This marriage produced a son in 1133, for whom his mother was able to assure the crown as Henry II, although she did not achieve it for herself.  She had, however, many supporters in England, including her uncle David, the king of Scotland, and her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I. Her opponents supported her cousin Stephen, whose claim was through his mother, Adela of Blois.(!2)  Matilda’s forces defeated and captured Stephen in 1141, but Matilda was never able to make good her claims, and was never called queen of England.  She was however briefly recognized by Stephen’s brother, the papal legate, and others as the “domina,” the ruling lady of England, according to William of Malmesbury, and she did exercize certain administrative powers in England.(!3)  Matilda’s courage and tenacity were respected by her enemies as well as her supporters.(!4)
Matilda removed to France in 1148 but continued to work for the succession of her son, Henry II.  She was called “empress” by him and others — even her second husband referred to her as the former wife of the Roman emperor.  After Henry’s accession, Matilda acted for him in Normandy, where she was recognized by Suger and Louis VII of France as its de facto ruler, and occasionally in England.  Her contacts with the papal court, and her experience of imperial administration made her a valuable advisor.  Matilda continued to have some influence over Henry, and to be asked to mediate between him and major opponents, like the archbishop of Canterbury and the king of France.(!5)

(!2) As Chibnall notes, “hostile chroniclers make plain that what might in a man have passed for dignity, resolution and firm control were condemned in her as arrogance, obstinacy, and anger,” 96-7; at the same time, Chibnall recognizes in Matilda some failures in political judgment and “understanding of men,” 115.

"64","Matilda of Scotland, queen of the English","queen of the English","Queen Matilda (Edith) was the daughter of Margaret of Scotland and Malcolm Canmore, king of Scotland.  As the wife of Henry I, son of William the Conqueror, she was queen of England from 1100 to her death, and it was she who carried English royal blood, as a direct descendant of Alfred through her mother.  Both Orderic Vitalis (HE 8.22, 10.16) and William of Malmesbury (GR 2.470-71) note Margaret's royal descent; her grandfather was Edmund Ironside, halfbrother of Edward known as the Confessor.
Matilda and her sister Mary were educated under the tutelage of their mother's sister, abbess Christina, at Romsey and Wilton.  Matilda was rumored to have taken the veil, though Anselm was persuaded it was a false rumor when he agreed to marry her to Henry.  William of Malmesbury says she wore the veil to discourage suitors.  Marjorie Chibnall suggests it may have been her aunt's idea to have her wear a veil without taking vows, to protect her from abduction, The Empress Matilda, Queen Consort, Queen Mother and Lady of the English (Oxford:  Blackwell, 1991), 7.  She was, however, devoted to religion and to Anselm as a spiritual advisor and friend, as well as to the needs of the kingdom, over which she served as regent when her husband was abroad.
Matilda's actions in that and other administrative capacities are mentioned in passing by Orderic (HE 6.10, 11.2).  Lois Huneycutt notes that Matilda not only participated in Henry's council, but chaired it in his absence, The Idea of the Perfect Princess:  The Life of St. Margaret in the Reign of Matilda II (1100-1118), Anglo-Norman Studies 12 (1989), 90.  Chibnall, 14, says that queen Matilda's correspondence with Anselm shows that her duties as queen came first, just as they did with her daughter the empress.  She bore two children, a son William who predeceased his father and a daughter Matilda, the empress, who became her father's heir and very nearly queen of England in her own right.
Matilda patronized churches and secular letters in Latin and French.  She commissioned at least two histories, a life of her mother, Margaret, from a monk of Durham, and an extended history of her family, the Gesta Regum Anglorum, from another monk William of Malmesbury, which was finished after her death and presented to her daughter, empress Matilda.(1)  William notes the queen's patronage of scholars, poets, and singers, though he thinks she favored foreigners at the cost of locals (5.418).  Benedeit dedicated the Voyage de saint Brendan to her and Philippe de Thaon the Livre de Sibylle.  M. Dominica Legge called Matilda the first known patron of French letters.(2)  Some short poems to Matilda are included below.
The bulk of Matilda's extant correspondence is with Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury and the ranking ecclesiastic of England, and an unusual number of the queen's letters to (and about) him survive.  The connection between them was both official by virtue of their offices, and personal in that he was a friend and spiritual advisor.  Anselm had performed her marriage ceremony and anointed her as queen, as she reminds him in ep.242, but his disputes over ecclesiastical jurisdiction first with Henry's brother, William Rufus, over vacant sees and simony, and then with Henry over lay investiture, kept him in exile on the continent for many years, and complicated his relations with Matilda as well.  Anselm went into exile in 1097 while William was king, was recalled by Henry in 1100, but went back into exile a second time, from 1103-06, during which Matilda continued to write to him and to plead his case.

"35","Marcella","","Marcella was a well-educated member of a senatorial family that included consuls and prefects; Pammachius, a close friend and correspondent of Jerome's, was her cousin.  Marcella was widowed after only seven months of marriage and refused other offers, prefering to live an ascetic religious life.  She and her mother Albina formed a religious community of women in their home on the Aventine, inspired by eastern monks; Athanasius had visited during his exile from Alexandria in the 340's.  Paula (Pammachius's mother-in-law and later Jerome's colleague in Jerusalem) and her daughter Eustochium were part of Marcella's community.  When Jerome came to Rome in 382, religious writings of his were already known and although he avoided the company of women, he gave in to Marcella's requests to give readings and lectures to her community and friends.  Won over by their devotion and interest, he became their friend, spiritual guide, and correspondent.  Several of his letters to Marcella come from this period, in response to things that arose while they were studying the bible together in Rome.  In a letter, Jerome spoke of Marcella as a teacher ""in the study of scriptures and sanctimony of mind and body,"" ep.65.2 to Principia.  When Jerome left Rome in 385, Paula and Eustochium followed him, but Marcella remained, studying and teaching, and taking an active role in religious controversies.  She continued to correspond with Jerome on religious matters and to look after his reputation in Rome.  As he tells her companion Principia after her death, ""we consoled our absence with mutual conversation, our letters continually crossed, we were joined by yoked letters"" (127.8).
Their correspondence began before Jerome left Rome, with questions that arose from their studies.  Seventeen of Jerome's extant letters are addressed to her, a small proportion of the actual correspondence, and none of hers is extant.(!1)  The letters we have reveal a deep personal friendship as well as scholarly collegiality.  She wrote frequently with questions; he often answered hastily, to try to keep up with them, knowing she was more concerned with the answers than with polished style (ep.29).  He refers regularly to Greek words, and the original Hebrew, notes relevant passages in Origen(!2) or Hilary, and discusses the errors he finds in other theologians or in the Septuagint quite openly with her.
After her death  — during the sack of Rome, she was attacked and beaten, courageously saved Principia, but died a few months later — Jerome wrote a letter about her at Principia's request (ep.127).  Though he hesitated to write it, because of the ""incredible sorrow that so oppressed my soul, that I judged it better to be silent than to say nothing worthy,"" he describes Marcella in some detail.  He speaks of her austere and self-denying life as a Christian widow, based on what she had heard of eastern monasticism from priests of Alexandria, which gave a model to others like Paula and Eustochium to follow.  Already in her adolescence Marcella had been attracted to austerity, praising that Plato who said philosophy was a meditation on death (127.6).  She overcame Jerome's hesitation to meet the eyes of noble women by her industry, so that it was she who enabled him to make the contacts with those women who would be so important for him.  She asked questions about scripture, always raising opposing points not to argue, but to learn, and then others came to learn from her:  ""all that I had gathered by long study and constant meditation, she drank in, learned and possessed, and after I left Rome, she answered any arguments that were put to her about scripture, including obscure and ambiguous inquiries from priests, saying that the answers came from me or another man, even when they were her own, claiming always to be a pupil even when she was teaching, so that she did not seem to injure the male sex because the apostle did not permit women to teach"" (ep.127.7).(!3)  This is an extraordinary justification of a woman teaching theology even to priests, and even if it requires subterfuge.(!4)  
Jerome also commends Marcella's battles against heresy, indeed he armed her with arguments against Montanists and Novatianists.  Later she helped expose the ""infamous"" interpretations of Origen which were gaining support among the clergy, priests and monks, until she opposed them publically, preferring to please God rather than men (127.9).  Bringing witnesses who had been taught by the heretics and correcting them, challenging them by frequent letters to defend themselves which they did not dare do, she was, Jerome claims, the ""beginning"" of the condemnation, the ""origin"" of the victory over the heretics (""damnationis hereticorum haec fuit `principium'. . . huius tam gloriosae victoriae `origo' Marcella est,"" with puns on Origen and his work [on ""first principles""] that seems to put Marcella on an intellectual level with a major Christian thinker, 127.10).(!5)","(!1) But Jerome sometimes suggests that Paula and Eustochium share the letters he sends them with Marcella, e.g.ep.30.14 to Paula, so the exchanges were more numerous than we can reckon.

(!2) Jerome often uses Origen's exegesis to explain scripture and clearly admires that aspect of his thought, though he eventually came to condemn some aspects of Origen's theology and to take an active part in the Origenist controversy.  He was goaded to some extent by Marcella and the fear she and other friends had that Jerome would be perceived as a heretic.  For Jerome's part in the controversy, see Elizabeth A. Clark, The Origenist Controversy, The Cultural Construction of an Early Christian Debate (Princeton:  Princeton University, 1992).

(!3) Abelard cited Jerome teaching and being closely questioned by Marcella (""she did not simply accept everything I said, but examined it and with a perceptive mind thought it all out so I felt myself to have not so much a disciple as a judge, ep.9), which says as much about Abelard's relation with Heloise as Jerome's with Marcella.  Heloise seemed to identify with Marcella, as Abelard did with Jerome; she cited the same passage about her (in the letter accompanying the Problemata), and also mentioned Jerome's encouraging her to teach others.  

(!4)  Of course, Marcella was a friend and supporter.  Jerome did not feel the same way about Melania the Elder, the renowned leader of a monastic community in Jerusalem, and friend and supporter of Rufinus.  Jerome wrote to Paulinus of Nola warning him against false guides who learn from women what to teach men, perhaps as much an attack on Rufinus as on Melania, see J.N.D. Kelly, Jerome, His Life, Writings, and Controversies (New York:  Harper and Row, 1975), 92.

(!5)  F.A.Wright, St. Jerome, Select Letters ¯ (Cambridge:  Harvard University, 1980, first pub.1933), Loeb Classical library, 262, includes the whole letter to Principia and talks about Marcella in an appendix on ""Jerome's Correspondence with Roman Women.""

Clark, Jerome, Chrysostom, and Friends, Essays and Translations (New York and Toronto:  Edwin Mellen, 1979).","330's ?","","410","Marcella  Marcella was a well-educated member of a senatorial family that included consuls and prefects; Pammachius, a close friend and correspondent of Jerome's, was her cousin.  Marcella was widowed after only seven months of marriage and refused other offers, prefering to live an ascetic religious life.  She and her mother Albina formed a religious community of women in their home on the Aventine, inspired by eastern monks; Athanasius had visited during his exile from Alexandria in the 340's.  Paula (Pammachius's mother-in-law and later Jerome's colleague in Jerusalem) and her daughter Eustochium were part of Marcella's community.  When Jerome came to Rome in 382, religious writings of his were already known and although he avoided the company of women, he gave in to Marcella's requests to give readings and lectures to her community and friends.  Won over by their devotion and interest, he became their friend, spiritual guide, and correspondent.  Several of his letters to Marcella come from this period, in response to things that arose while they were studying the bible together in Rome.  In a letter, Jerome spoke of Marcella as a teacher ""in the study of scriptures and sanctimony of mind and body,"" ep.65.2 to Principia.  When Jerome left Rome in 385, Paula and Eustochium followed him, but Marcella remained, studying and teaching, and taking an active role in religious controversies.

"29","Matilda of Tuscany, countess of Tuscany, duchess of Lorraine","countess of Tuscany, duchess of Lorraine","Matilda, countess of Tuscany as the heir of her father Boniface, margrave of Tuscany, was the major imperial feudatory in Italy and the major secular supporter of the reform papacy through a long life, 1046-1115.(1)   After Boniface's death, Matilda's mother Beatrice married her cousin, Godfrey, duke of Upper Lorraine, and Matilda married his son, Godfrey.  When the elder Godfrey died in 1069, Matilda and her mother assumed the rule of Tuscany together; after the deaths of both her mother and her husband in 1076, Matilda ruled both Tuscany and Lorraine alone.  Matilda held the counties of Reggio, Modena, Mantua, Brescia, Verona, and Ferrara, as well as Tuscany and Upper and Lower Lorraine.  Some documents recording her judgments begin with the formula:  ""Dum . . . in civitate x . . . residesset domina Mactilda, ducatrix et marchionissa, ad causas audiendas hac deliberandas,"" ""While lady Matilda, duchess and marchioness, was residing in the city of x to hear and deliberate cases,"" Die Urkunden und Briefe der Markgräfin Mathilde von Tuszien, ed. Elke Goez and Werner Goez, MGH Laienfürsten und Dynasten Urkunden der Kaiserzeit (Hanover:  Hahnsche Buchhandlung, 1998), 12, 1074.
Through her mother and maternal grandmother, Matilda of Swabia, sister of empress Gisela, Matilda was first cousin once-removed of emperor Henry III and second cousin of Henry IV.  In her first marriage to Godfrey, Matilda gave birth to one child who did not live; she contracted a purely political marriage in 1089 with Welf/Guelph of Bavaria, then 17, at the insistence of pope Urban II in a move to counter imperial power, but the marriage was, by the groom's report, never consummated.  She made a donation to the apostolic see of her entire allodial inheritance in full proprietorship, though reserving the rights of disposal during her lifetime and that of the young emperor Henry V, her chosen heir.  That donation was to play a part in imperial-papal conflicts for several centuries.  Dante's contemporaries, his earliest commentators, and the chronicler Giovanni Villani still speak of the Matildine lands, and Dante invokes her memory in the Matelda of the Earthly Paradise, according to his early commentators.(2) 
Matilda's support of the reform papacy was unwavering.  From the time of Alexander II, through Gregory VII, Urban II and Paschal II, she gave financial and military assistance.  She was there with her troops and she had a number of striking military successes as well as setbacks, but she consistently opposed the anti-popes of the empire, even when her own position was threatened.  She offered refuge and protection to reform clergy like Anselm of Canterbury, Bonizo of Sutri, Gregory VII, as well as to the fleeing wife and rebellious son of the emperor.
Gregory VII relied particularly on the support of Matilda, saying again and again in his letters to them that she and her mother are the only princes he can trust.(3)  Their support of his reforms set them against not only the empire, but also the German bishops whose loyalty was to the empire, so it is not surprising that Gregory's relations with them were viewed with hostility by ecclesiastical figures.  A letter to him from the German bishops declares their antagonism quite openly; they speak of the very grave scandal to the church of his unnecessarily intimate relations with a foreign woman (""de convictu et cohabitatione aliene mulieris familiariori quam necesse est""), and the ""general complaint that is heard everywhere that all judgments, all decrees in the apostolic see are enacted by women, that the whole world of the church is administered by this new senate of women"" (""per hunc feminarum novum senatum,"" MGH BZHIV, 1.20, Jan.1076).
Matilda was indeed involved in papal politics, particularly as concerned the empire.  She was a key witness to the agreements reached at Canossa, as Gregory's letter to ""all the archbishops, bishops, dukes, counts, and other princes of the Germans"" describes it:  he says he received assurances from Henry and ""the confirmation of them at the hands of the abbot of Cluny [Hugh], our daughters Matilda and the countess Adela [of Turin], and other princes, bishops, and laymen who seemed useful to us for this"" (ep.4.12, Jan. 1077).  And she kept the pope informed of matters of political interest, like the emperor's agreement with Robert Guiscard to marry their children and have Robert withdraw his support from the pope, ep.9.11.  None of Matilda's letters to Gregory are extant though contemporary references are made to them, see below on lost documents.
Because of her vast holdings and her courageous support of the papacy, Matilda was a subject of attention to contemporary chroniclers and poets.  Those who were sympathetic to her positions were lavish in their praise:  Ekkehard called her the wealthiest, most famous woman of our times and most distinguished in virtues; Hugh of Flavigny said ""at this time only countess Matilda was found among women who scorned the power of the king, who opposed his cunning and power even with military conflict, so was deservedly called 'virago,' who surpassed even men by the virtue of her spirit.""(4)   Bardone in his life of Anselm of Lucca speaks of ""the single and only one who remains in the faith, with zeal for God and obedient to pope Gregory, the duke and countess Matilda"" (Vita Anselmi Episcopi Lucensis, MGH SS 12, p.16).(5)   Orderic Vitalis mentions her briefly but approvingly as an old opponent of the emperor and supporter of legitimate popes, Gregory, Urban, and Pascal (Ecclesiastical History 10.1).  Donizo composed a verse life of Matilda in which he speaks not only of her virtues and her military and diplomatic achievements, her winning over some with gifts, others with arms — he was an eye-witness of her second war against the emperor (1090-97) — but also of her intellectual powers, her letters attacking the errors of the king, her knowledge of the German language, and her ability to speak French as well as to dictate in Latin (II, 42-43, 293-97).  Matilda was also a patron of letters, who commissioned lives of Anselm of Lucca from Bardone and Rangerio, for whom Anselm of Lucca composed prayers and Donizo her own life, and to whom Anselm of Canterbury sent a newly expanded collection of his prayers.
Die Urkunden und Briefe der Markgräfin Mathilde von Tuszien prints 139 legal documents and letters by or in the name of the countess, as well as 14 spurious letters, and references to 115 lost documents.  Since most of the documents are legal acts, grants, confirmations, taking under protection, assuring possessions, transfers and sales, or judgments delivered at public hearings over which she presided, involving laymen and religious including bishops and abbots, most are not included here except for a few examples, though technically they might all be considered public letters.  More than half (59%) are in the first person.  Most of the spurious documents are gifts, grants, confirmations, special privileges:  only one (Die Urkunden 140), a proposal of marriage to her second husband which is cited in a roughly contemporary chronicle, is included; another interesting but much later call to share in the liberating of Italy (Die Urkunden, 142) is not.
The 115 missing documents are all known from contemporary works that relate Matilda's messages, acts, or judgments.  Some may have been delivered by word of mouth, directly or through a messenger; others were clearly letters and those are summarized briefly here:
Dep.3 cites the Annales of Ptolemy of Lucca:  ""In the year of the lord 1065, the countess Matilda wrote him [pope Alexander II] a very personal letter, offering her help against all princes and any people, and asking him for a cleric of honorable life, gracious conversation, and healthy counsel, who could direct her.""
Dep.16 from Chronicon S. Huberti Andaginensis describes letters Matilda sent Gregory VII through abbot Dietrich to intercede for the abbot who had been deceived by Godfrey the Hunchback about his father's alms.
Dep.18, letters from Beatrice and Matilda to Gregory VII, mentioned in his letter to emperor Henry IV (ep.2.30), telling him about Henry's friendship and love for him; Gregory tells Henry it was their counsel and the persuasion of his beloved mother (empress Agnes) that led him to write.
Dep.35 cites Gregory's letter to abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino, asking him to be alert to a threatening situation Matilda had revealed in a letter about Henry's agreement with Robert Guiscard to marry their children and have Robert withdraw his support from the pope, ep.9.11, dated 1081.
In letters to Matilda, or to Beatrice and Matilda, Gregory also mentions their letters to him, see below ep.1.11, 1.40, 1.47, 1.77, 3.5, 6.22; and in 1.85 to empress Agnes, Gregory refers to a letter to her from Matilda.
Dep.44 from the Prologue to John of Mantua's Tractatus in Cantica Canticorum recording that she had asked him to write the commentary.
Dep.45 from John of Mantua's Liber de sancta Maria records her request for an exposition of the writings about Mary in the Gospels.
Dep.48 cites a letter to Matilda from archbishop Hugh of Lyon in the Chronicon of Hugh of Flavigny, saying that he has been compelled to come to Rome and stay there longer than the demands of his office allow by letters from the Roman church and blessed Anselm of revered memory, and legations and letters from her.
Dep.78 among the documents of Paschal II mentions a request from Matilda to confirm the possessions of a monastery.
Dep.92 among the documents of Calixtus II mentions other requests by Matilda for canons and monks.

(2)It is striking that Dante makes a woman the only inhabitant of the earthly paradise, which he posits as the secular goal of mankind on earth in De monarchia, and even more striking that he chooses a woman who was a powerful secular ruler and supporter of the reform papacy, if the early commentators are correct in their identification, as I believe they are.

(3)Gregory speaks warmly of their support even in letters to others.  He wrote to Herlembald, knight of Milan and leader of the commune, that he need not fear the bishops who supported his enemy, since Beatrice and Matilda, ""altogether favoring the church, labor with certain great nobles to unite our spirit firmly with the king's"" (1.26, Oct. 1073).

Dep.44 from the Prologue to John of Mantua's Tractatus in Cantica Canticorum recording that she had asked him to write the commentary.
Dep.45 from John of Mantua's Liber de sancta Maria records her request for an exposition of the writings about Mary in the Gospels.
Dep.48 cites a letter to Matilda from archbishop Hugh of Lyon in the Chronicon of Hugh of Flavigny, saying that he has been compelled to come to Rome and stay there longer than the demands of his office allow by letters from the Roman church and blessed Anselm of revered memory, and legations and letters from her.
Dep.78 among the documents of Paschal II mentions a request from Matilda to confirm the possessions of a monastery.
Dep.92 among the documents of Calixtus II mentions other requests by Matilda for canons and monks.

"36","Brunhild, queen of Austrasia and Burgundy","queen of Austrasia and Burgundy","A Visigothic princess, daughter of Athanagild of Spain, who maintained relations with Spain through most of her life, Brunhild was married to Sigebert of Metz (son of Chlothar I).(!1)   Unlike some contemporary queens who converted their husbands to orthodox belief, Brunhild was an Arian who was converted by her marriage and later established good working relations with pope Gregory I.  After Sigebert’s death (575), Brunhild married Merovech, the son of Sigebert’s halfbrother, Chilperic, but Merovech took refuge in or was confined to a monastery and played no real part in Brunhild’s life.  Brunhild ruled Austrasia and Burgundy for and then with her son, Childebert II, until his death in 596 at age 26; then she ruled for her young grandsons, Theodebert II, heir to Austrasia, and Theoderic II, heir to Burgundy.  Theoderic remained on good terms with his grandmother all his life; a letter from Gregory to him dated 602 praises him for being so eager to support his grandmother (ep.13.9).  He did not marry, having all his sons by concubines, which left Brunhild more say in the succession, and thus more support from potential heirs.  Liaisons with concubines were normal being more likely to ensure male heirs than marriage with one legitimate wife, and male heirs were important to Brunhild’s remaining in power.
Brunhild’s successful political manoeuvring and long rule inevitably brought her enemies, among them Theodebert’s wife Bilichild, Brunhild’s former slave, who expelled Brunhild from their court.(!2)  The queen took refuge with Theoderic in Burgundy but Theoderic died at 27 in 613, leaving an eleven-year old heir, Sigibert.  Brunhild tried to rule for him, but she was captured and horribly executed at the order of her nephew, Clothar II.  Clothar was the son of Sigebert’s half-brother Chilperic and Fredegund, the woman Brunhild held responsible for her own sister’s death — Chilperic had had his former wife, Galswinth, Brunhild’s sister, murdered.  The death of Brunhild was the last act in a long feud between the two.
Brunhild had, however, ruled as regent for the better part of thirty-eight years and had developed relations with both Spain and Byzantium as well as the papacy.  She is certainly a model for the figure of Brunhild, a powerful queen in her own right in Germanic and Norse legend, lover of Siegfried, and wife of a Burgundian king.  Traces of that tradition are found in the Nibelungenlied.

Ingeborg was married to Philip II king of France in August, 1193, with a large dowry from her brother Knut VI, king of Denmark.  From that point on, her life and her letters were dominated by Philip’s attempts to repudiate her.  For the two decades that the divorce proceedings lasted, Ingeborg made her presence felt on the political and ecclesiastical scene, although she was never active as consort or regent.  She had spent no more than one night with her husband, after which he rejected and imprisoned her and did all he could to have the marriage annulled.
There is a lot of speculation but no solid knowledge about Philip’s sudden revulsion.  Some have suggested a hidden physical deformity in her, though contemporary descriptions, even allowing for some exaggeration, attest to good looks and character:  Rigord called her a “pulcherrima puella, mirabili decore praedita; puella sancta, bonis moribus ornata, quam generositatis egregiae ac multae decus honestatis adornat,” “a very lovely girl, endowed with wondrous beauty, a holy girl, adorned with good customs, graced by outstanding generosity and great honesty.”(!1) Others posit Philip’s disappointment over the lack of Danish support for a French invasion of England, or a conflict of wills between the two that emerged on the first night and just got worse.(!2)   The king’s sudden trembling during the wedding ceremony has been diagnosed by John Baldwin as the symptom of a disease Philip contracted on crusade.(!3)   The king summoned French prelates to Compiègne, and they pronounced a divorce on the grounds of consanguinity in November, 1193,(!4) grounds which were rejected at Soissons in 1201.
Philip claimed for many years that the marriage had never been consummated, while Ingeborg insisted from the beginning that it had been.  She said he was motivated by diabolical incitement and the persuasion of malitious princes, whom she also held responsible for his marrying Agnes of Meran, daughter of a duke of Andechs-Meranien, who bore him children and died in 1201.  Philip claimed non-consummation “per maleficium,” impotence caused by sorcery.  Philip did not admit that intercourse had occurred until 1212, then he tried to argue that there was no insemination.  Meanwhile, Ingeborg accused Philip of bigamy and adultery described herself as “proscripta,” an outlaw and exile (Conklin, 43).  She was, in fact, imprisoned, without funds, and forced to live an austere and lonely existence, but she continued to fight the divorce, writing to a series of popes, Celestine III, who condemned Philip’s actions in 1195, Innocent III, who, when Philip refused to restore her in 1200 imposed an interdict on France.  Philip got the interdict lifted by faking a reconciliation with Ingeborg, but only briefly, after which she was imprisoned even more strictly.
At times Ingeborg was worn down by Philip’s cruelty, but as a queen and the daughter and sister of a king, she had the will and the prestige to fight.  She also had the support of her brother, the king of Denmark, who was charged by the pope with having her case prepared for the hearing, and the official support of the popes even if their help was sometimes cautious.  Finally in 1213, Philip took her back, but only pro forma, and perhaps in preparation for a planned attack on the English king John.  After Philip died in 1223, however, Ingeborg was well treated by her stepson, Louis VIII, and by his son, Louis IX, and she participated in royal events:  in 1239 she rode at the head of the procession to celebrate the arrival of the crown of thorns with the queen mother, Blanche, and Louis IX’s queen Marguerite.(!5) She controlled her dower lands and endowed churches and hospitals and religious establishments, and had the satisfaction of outliving her husband by some fourteen years and paying large sums of money to have masses said for his soul.
Conklin notes that Ingeborg uses terms in her letters that are just gaining currency in papal rhetoric, like calling the pope “vicarius Christi,” the vicar of Christ, and his power “gladius spiritus,” the sword of the spirt.  He also argues that Ingeborg may have had an important role in composing the letters sent in her name, that she was literate, according to Stephen of Tournai, that she may have had herself informed about canon law because of her situation, that the blend of legal argument and personal expression all the way through the correspondence, even while her advisors changed, suggests one voice (51).

Beatrice, a skilled diplomat in her own right, had seven brothers who were loyal to the family and gifted players in the diplomatic world of Europe.  All four of her daughters were married to kings, a phenomenon noted by Dante (Par. 6.133-35).  The oldest sister, Marguerite, was queen of France, married to Louis IX in 1234; the second, Eleanor, was queen of England, married to Henry III in 1236; the youngest sister, Beatrice, heir to Provence, married Charles of Anjou in 1246 and became Queen of Naples in 1266.  Sanchia was the second wife of Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III, whom she married in 1243.  She became Queen of the Romans when he was elected emperor in 1256; they were crowned in 1257 at Aachen.  Sanchia and Richard had one son who survived, Edmund of Cornwall.(!1)
Sanchia, whose marriage portion was 5000 marks, had been married by proxy to Raymond VII of Toulouse, but Raymond had not obtained an annulment of his previous marriage.  Richard, whose first wife died in 1240, met Sanchia in Provence in 1241 and was amenable to a marriage that strengthened Henry's position on the continent and involved Richard more closely with Henry's interests.  Sanchia and her sister Eleanor appear to have been in close contact after she came to England (see Howell, 185, n.43).  Sanchia was officially recognized by Henry as a voice in family dynastic matters, e.g.:  ""Grant to Peter de Sabaudia [uncle to Sanchia and to Queen Eleanor] that if he have an heir male of his wife, he may assign or bequeath the wardship of his lands and heir to whom he will.  The king also wills that the said heir shall not be married to anyone without the consent of Queen Eleanor and of Sanchia, countess of Cornwall, and the brothers of the said Peter"" (Calendar of Patent Rolls, 4.220, 1253, Aug.3).  And she had some influence pleading for others:  A pardon to a man who received an outlaw and a licence to another man to enclose a wood at her instance are recorded in the Patent Rolls, 4.455, 1255, January 8 and 4.536, 1256, January 2.
Sanchia joined the family gathering in Chartres and Paris in 1254, when Louis IX and queen Marguerite received Henry III and queen Eleanor; her mother Countess Beatrice and her youngest sister Beatrice were also present.  Sanchia had also accompanied her husband on an embassy to Louis in 1250.  She died in November, 1261 at Berkhampstead and was buried at the abbey of Hailes (Cox, 310).  A grant ""for the saving of the king's soul and the soul of Senchia, queen of Almain, to the master and brethren of the hospital of St. Katharine without the Tower of Lond, of 50s. a year at the Exchequer for the maintenance of a chaplain celebrating divine service daily in the chapel of St. John within the Tower for her soul"" is recorded in the Patent Rolls of Henry III, 5.195 for December 7, 1261.","(!1) For information about the family in England, see Margaret Howell, Eleanor of Provence, Queenship in 13th century England (Oxford:  Blackwell, 1998).

The oldest sister, Marguerite, was queen of France, married to Louis IX in 1234; the second, Eleanor, was queen of England, married to Henry III in 1236; the youngest sister, Beatrice, heir to Provence, married Charles of Anjou in 1246 and became Queen of Naples in 1266.  Sanchia was the second wife of Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III, whom she married in 1243.  She became Queen of the Romans when he was elected emperor in 1256; they were crowned in 1257 at Aachen.  Sanchia and Richard had one son who survived, Edmund of Cornwall.(!1)
Sanchia, whose marriage portion was 5000 marks, had been married by proxy to Raymond VII of Toulouse, but Raymond had not obtained an annulment of his previous marriage.  Richard, whose first wife died in 1240, met Sanchia in Provence in 1241 and was amenable to a marriage that strengthened Henry's position on the continent and involved Richard more closely with Henry's interests.  Sanchia and her sister Eleanor appear to have been in close contact after she came to England (see Howell, 185, n.43).  Sanchia was officially recognized by Henry as a voice in family dynastic matters, e.g.:  ""Grant to Peter de Sabaudia [uncle to Sanchia and to Queen Eleanor] that if he have an heir male of his wife, he may assign or bequeath the wardship of his lands and heir to whom he will.  The king also wills that the said heir shall not be married to anyone without the consent of Queen Eleanor and of Sanchia, countess of Cornwall, and the brothers of the said Peter"" (Calendar of Patent Rolls, 4.220, 1253, Aug.3).  And she had some influence pleading for others:  A pardon to a man who received an outlaw and a licence to another man to enclose a wood at her instance are recorded in the Patent Rolls, 4.455, 1255, January 8 and 4.536, 1256, January 2.
Sanchia joined the family gathering in Chartres and Paris in 1254, when Louis IX and queen Marguerite received Henry III and queen Eleanor; her mother Countess Beatrice and her youngest sister Beatrice were also present.  Sanchia had also accompanied her husband on an embassy to Louis in 1250.  She died in November, 1261 at Berkhampstead and was buried at the abbey of Hailes (Cox, 310).  A grant ""for the saving of the king's soul and the soul of Senchia, queen of Almain, to the master and brethren of the hospital of St. Katharine without the Tower of Lond, of 50s. a year at the Exchequer for the maintenance of a chaplain celebrating divine service daily in the chapel of St. John within the Tower for her soul"" is recorded in the Patent Rolls of Henry III, 5.195 for December 7, 1261.

For information about the family in Europe, see Eugene L. Cox, The Eagles of Savoy (Princeton:  Princeton University, 1974).  N. Denholm-Young, Richard of Cornwall (New York:  William Salloch, 1947), gives little information about Sanchia, though he cites a chronicle, Chronicon vulgo dictum Chronicon Thomae Wykes, on Sanchia's incomparable beauty. 1228?  1261"
"71","Isabel of Angoulême","Queen of England, Countess of Angoulême and La Marche","Isabel, daughter and heiress of Audemar/Ademer,(!1) count of Angoulême, was the second wife of King John of England, whom she married in 1200.

"73","Marguerite of Provence","Queen of France","Marguerite was the eldest of four daughters of Raymond Berengar V, count of Provence (grandson, nephew and cousin of kings of Aragon, +1245) and Beatrice of Savoy (+1266).  Her mother, Beatrice, a skilled diplomat in her own right, had eight brothers six of whom lived long enough to be gifted players in the diplomatic world of Europe.  Her father, Raymond Berengar supported Rome against the Albigensians and Raymond of Toulouse, and agreed to Marguerite's marriage to the king of France at the urging of the papacy.  All four daughters were married to kings, a phenomenon noted by Dante (Par. 6.133-35):  Marguerite married Louis IX of France in 1234, Eleanor Henry III of England in 1236; Sancha in 1243 married Richard of Cornwall, who became king of the Romans and Emperor in 1257, and Beatrice (heir to her father's land) married Charles I of Anjou, brother of Louis IX, who became king of Sicily in 1246.  Louis IX of France, who was later canonized, was 19 when he married Marguerite and still under the tutelage/regency of his mother, Blanche of Castile, who seems to have resented her daughter-in-law.(!1)
Marguerite and Louis had 11 children, Blanche (1240-43), Isabelle (1242-71), Louis (1244-60), Philip III (1245-85, king of France from 1270), Jean (1248), Jean-Tristan (1250-70), Pierre (1251-84), Blanche (1253-1323), Marguerite (1254-77), Robert (1256-1318), Agnes (1260-1327).  Isabelle married Thibaud V, count of Champagne and king of Navarre in 1255; Philip married Isabella of Aragon in 1262, and after her death, Marie of Brabant in 1274; Jean-Tristan married Yolande de Nevers in 1266; Pierre married Jeanne d'Alençon in 1277 and became count of Alençon; Blanche married Ferdinand of Castille and Marguerite married Jean of Brabant in 1269; Robert, count of Clermont, married Beatrice of Bourbon in 1277; and Agnes married Robert of Burgundy in 1279.  Sivéry reports that Marguerite is named in the marriage contracts on equal terms with Louis, 145.  None of the children entered the church.
Marguerite ruled directly for only a few months in 1250, in Damietta during a crusade, but she was frequently called on for diplomatic manoevres, to float plans that might not have immediately appealed to government counsellors loyal to the old politics of Louis VIII and Blanche and, as the letters show, she did undertake certain kinds of diplomatic mediation.(!2)
Marguerite accompanied Louis on crusade in 1248, along with Louis's two brothers, Alfonse of Poitiers and Charles of Anjou and their wives, Jeanne de Toulouse and Marguerite's sister Blanche of Provence.  Louis, who had vowed to undertake the crusade when he was quite ill, took his vow seriously and refused to return before 1254, even though his regent, his mother Blanche who had been opposed to the undertaking, died in 1252.  Marguerite gave birth to three of her children during this period, Jean-Tristan, who was born during his father's captivity, Pierre, and Blanche.  Louis set out for Cairo, leaving Damietta, troops, and the royal fleet in Marguerite's hands, but he was captured during a retreat from Mansourah, and held for ransom.  From her bed of childbirth, Marguerite persuaded the Pisans and Genoese who wanted to leave Damietta to stay, by promising to buy food for them and distribute it and she agreed to the terms for Louis's release.
When Marguerite's uncle, Thomas of Savoy was captured in an attack on Asti in 1255, she persuaded her husband to help him, by joining other members of the family in seizing Asti bankers within their territories and using their goods to pay the ransom.  During the dissensions in England, Louis had Marguerite negotiate for him with Henry and Eleanor, while his counsellors were working against Henry; in the same period, Eleanor asked Marguerite to reconcile Gaston de Béarn with her brother-in-law Alfonse of Poitiers, and Marguerite handled the awkward requests for Alfonse's ships to help Henry (Howell, 200, Sivéry, chapter 9).  But Louis did not want Marguerite to be regent for their son Philip, in case of his own death, perhaps because of the enmity between her and his brother, Charles of Anjou over the Provençal inheritance.
Charles was married to Eleanor's youngest sister, Beatrice, who was her father's heir in Provence, but the other three sisters had claims to parts of the land, over which Marguerite and Eleanor fought at length with Charles.  When Louis went on his last crusade, where he died in 1270, the regents he had left tried to seize Marguerite's dower (which was similar to what Blanche's had been), but she fought them and then her son's regents, until her son granted reparations to her.  After 1280, Philip III also supported her claims in Provence, and Marguerite did homage to Rudolph of Hapsburg, king of the Romans, who may have invested her with the county of Provence, though Charles never surrendered it.  Philip let her raise an army to oppose Charles, perhaps using Marguerite for his own diplomatic purposes as his father had, to do what he could not do directly.  Eventually, Marguerite's grandson, Charles of Valois, married a granddaughter of Charles, who brought Anjou to the family as her dowry.","(!1)Gérard Sivéry, Marguerite de Provence, Une reine au temps des cathédrales (Paris:  Fayard, 1987), 55, 69-70, 73.

After Francis returned to Assisi with oral approval from Pope Innocent III for his form of life, Clare heard Francis preach. Convinced by his message after a series of conversations, Clare escaped her family home and was tonsured at the hands of Francis in the small church of Saint Mary of the Angels. 
After her tonsure, Francis and the brothers took Clare to San Paolo delle Abbadesse, a Benedictine monastery whose privileges included the threat of excommunication towards anyone who dared molest the inhabitants of the monastery. The seven knights of her family came to the monastery to threaten Clare, but Clare stood her ground showing them her shorn hair. Seeing that she could not be persuaded, and realizing that because of her hair she could not be wed to a nobleman, Clare's family disowned her. With her safety thus assured, Francis took Clare to the Monastery of Sant'Angelo di Panzo which was a smaller and simpler monastery and was nearer to San Damiano. 
Clare's sister Catherine, who was renamed Agnes by St. Francis, joined Clare at Sant'Angelo. The wrath of the Offreduccio knights followed and, as a result of their physical abuse, Catherine nearly died in the struggle. Clare nursed Catherine back to health and the two settled shortly after in the Monastery of San Damiano just outside Assisi.

Clare negotiated the Privilege of Poverty, which guaranteed that the sisters living within the Monastery of San Damiano would not be forced to accept possessions.

"76","Eleanor of Provence","Queen of England","Eleanor was one of the four daughters of Raymond Berengar V, count of Provence (grandson, nephew and cousin of kings of Aragon) and Beatrice of Savoy, a skilled diplomat from an important family.  All four daughters were married to kings, a phenomenon noted by Dante (Par. 6.133-35):  Marguerite married Louis IX of France in 1234, Eleanor Henry III of England in 1236(!1); Sancha in 1243 married Richard of Cornwall, who became king of the Romans and Emperor in 1257, and Beatrice (heir to her father's land) married Charles I of Anjou, brother of Louis IX, who became king of Sicily in 1246.  Eleanor and Henry had five children:  Edward I (born 1239), who succeeded his father in 1272, Margaret (b.1240) who married Alexander III of Scotland in 1251, Beatrice (b.1242) who married John II of Brittany, Edmund, earl of Lancaster (b.1245), and Katharine who lived less than four years (1253-57).
Eleanor supervised the education of her son Edward, and watched over him, staying with him for three weeks when he was sick in 1246 in the Cistercian abbey at Beaulieu against Cistercian rules(!2). She was the designated keeper of castles for him if Henry died, and worked consistently for his interests, with the support of her Savoyard uncles, who played important roles in the English court in the 1240's and 1250's(!3).  Edward rebelled against his mother and her family for a time, but he came to respect her abilities and value her devotion during the struggle to retain royal power, and they remained on good terms for the rest of her life.
There were times when Eleanor had to negotiate between her uncle Boniface, archbishop of Canterbury, and her husband, but he and Peter of Savoy were strong and key supporters of Eleanor and the monarchy.  Howell describes Eleanor as a ""highly significant political figure in the struggle between the king and the baronage,"" noting that she ""encouraged the use of contingents of foreign knights to strengthen the royal power"" in times of crisis, that she ""gathered an army in the Low Countries, negotiated confidently with Louis IX of France and with the papacy, and by her energy and commitment helped to bring about the overthrow of Simon de Montfort and the rescue of her husband and eldest son from his control"" (xviii).
Though Eleanor's political involvement led to some conflicts with Henry in the early 1250's, including her support of Simon de Montfort's actions in Gascony (Howell, chapter 3), he continued to rely on her abilities.  When he left to deal with a rebellion in Gascony, Henry made a will leaving care of his heir and other children and all his territories to Eleanor, and appointed her regent, with the counsel (not co-regency) of his brother Richard:  ""Whereas the king has committed the governance of the realm of England and of the lands of Wales and Ireland to Queen Eleanor with the counsel of his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall, until his return from Gascony...,"" Patent Rolls, 4.206, July 3, 1253.
While the king was in Gascony, the entries in the Patent Rolls for 1253-54 are usually attested, that is officially issued, by either the queen or the earl of Cornwall, or both together.  From August through October, they both ""sign"" in 5 of 6, but from November through the following May, she is the sole issuer in 40, he in 7.
In 1258, as her son was moving away from her and the Savoyard influence, there was an open split between Eleanor and the Lusignans who attempted to slander her, though the details of the slanders are not clear (Howell, chapter 6).  But although she suffered from the anti-foreign feelings — she was once attacked by a mob from London Bridge when she was trying to go upriver (Howell, 196) — and the resentment against heavy taxation in the period of upheaval (1258-1263), Eleanor played a major role in restoring her husband and son to power (Howell, chapters 7 to 10).  She was able to work with her enemies when it was in the interests of her husband and son, and she was highly effective at raising diplomatic and military support from her friends on the continent for their cause.
The queen also kept royal authority alive in Gascony, by going there and asserting it herself, while Henry and Edward were under Simon de Montfort's control.  The Gascons and the French king Louis IX accepted Eleanor's right to act for Henry even in defiance of writs that were issued in his name at Simon's instance.  Her success at raising an army to invade England in support of her captive husband and son was admired even by her enemies.  But Eleanor's talents were financial as well as diplomatic.  She had some control over her own resources and the appointments of her officials, and she managed to increase her holdings by buying debts and taking or leasing land given in surety for them and she held profitable wardships.  She dealt with Jewish and Florentine financeers and her credit was good because she paid her debts(!4). As a widow, Eleanor guarded her dowager rights, and kept her holdings even after she retired to the convent of Amesbury in 1286, a daughter-house of Fontevrault.  At Amesbury, Eleanor joined two granddaughters, Edward's daughter Mary, and Beatrice's daughter Eleanor (who later became abbess of Fontevrault); they had both entered in 1285 at the queen's urging.  She had a disagreement with Edward's wife, Eleanor of Castile, about Mary's enclosure, but they cooperated on behalf of another daughter, Eleanor, together convincing Edward in 1282 to keep his eldest daughter home an extra year after her marriage was contracted at 13 (Parsons, 37).
Though Amesbury was Benedictine, Eleanor had always been sympathetic and generous to the Franciscans, and had looked to them for spiritual guidance, particularly Robert Grosseteste, Adam Marsh, and Thomas of Hales (Howell, chapter 4).  She was rumored to have written a 12,000 line romance, Blandin de Cournouailles, in her youth, but that legend has been discredited; she is known, however, to have purchased romances and she was the dedicatee of several books, the French life of Edward the Confessor perhaps by Matthew Paris and Rossignos by John of Howden (de Hoveden), the latter after her husband's death(!5). Its subject matter suggests an interest in classical and Arthurian romance.  Eleanor also carried on an extensive correspondence.  Howell reports that some 160 of her letters to others are extant, many unpublished (293), and her messenger lists indicate the wide range of her correspondents (Howell, 106)(!6). There are references to letters she wrote, which may not be extant:  Adam Marsh mentioned in one letter to W. of Nottingham, a provincial minister, that the queen had written him an affectionate and powerful letter, asking him to come to her when he could (""Scripsit mihi domina regina litteram affectuosam et efficacem, ut, cum opportunitas se offeret, praesentiam ipsius adire non omitterem""), which Adam says would be difficult for him.  Meanwhile, the countess of Leicester, Henry's sister, has also asked him to come to her, and he is anxious about that as well (ep.172).  In another letter to the same person, in which he speaks of his then troubled relations with the archbishop of Canterbury, the queen's uncle, Adam says that there were letters from the queen with petitions for W., and a letter she sent Adam, which he sends on to W. (""A domina regina quoque, ut ipse mihi postea dixit, obtinuit litteras cum propriis petitoriis ad vos, pro beneplaciti sui complemento ad vos destinatas, qui postquam veni Oxoniam misit mihi litteram, quam praesentibus inclusam vobis transmitto,"" ep.188).  Some of her letters are mentioned in the Calendar of the Patent Rolls, e.g. 4.557, ""Notification that the king has inspected a letter obligatory of Queen Eleanor and Peter de Sabaudia [Savoy] to the abbot and convent of Cyrencestre touching a loan""; 4.558, ""the queen having accepted his said account, and made quittance thereof by letters patent, which the king has inspected""; 4.635, ""Inspeximus and confirmation of a writing of the queen to the abbot and convent of Wardon""; 5.123, ""The king of France has like letters patent of the queen [of England] sealed with the queen's seal.""  Many of the documents in the Patent Rolls reflect Eleanor's involvement in financial matters, holding or selling wardships, making or buying loans, recommending or granting the pardon of debts (!7): 3.244, 1241, Feb.12:  Notification that John Lestrange to whom the king has committed the castles of Muntgumery, Shrewsbury and Bruges and the castles likewise of the county of Chester, during pleasure, has sworn on the Holy Gospels before the king and by letters patent bound himself that, in the event of the king's death, he will deliver the said castles to Eleanor, his queen, to the use of Edward his son and heir or another heir begotten or to be begotten by the king of the said queen; the king has granted to him that from the time when he has delivered the said castles to the queen, or her assigns, or if the king resume them, the said bond shall not be binding, but he and his heirs shall be quit therefore.

3.283  1242, April 26:  Notification that Queen Eleanor, by licence of the king, has given to Bernard de Sabaudia [Savoy] the custody of Isabel the younger daughter and one of the heirs of Roger de Akeni, and of the land falling to her of the inheritance of her father, with her marriage, if the matrimony before contracted with her ought not to stand.

Whence, the bailiffs who were established under that brother William, assuming horns from the patronage of such a lady, oppressed the neighbors and with little or no cause impoverished them.  And thus, as in ancient days, many kings tyrannized in England,"" CM, 5.621 for 1257.","1223","","1291","Eleanor of Provence Queen of England Eleanor was one of the four daughters of Raymond Berengar V, count of Provence (grandson, nephew and cousin of kings of Aragon) and Beatrice of Savoy, a skilled diplomat from an important family.  All four daughters were married to kings, a phenomenon noted by Dante (Par. 6.133-35):  Marguerite married Louis IX of France in 1234, Eleanor Henry III of England in 1236(!1); Sancha in 1243 married Richard of Cornwall, who became king of the Romans and Emperor in 1257, and Beatrice (heir to her father's land) married Charles I of Anjou, brother of Louis IX, who became king of Sicily in 1246.  Eleanor and Henry had five children:  Edward I (born 1239), who succeeded his father in 1272, Margaret (b.1240) who married Alexander III of Scotland in 1251, Beatrice (b.1242) who married John II of Brittany, Edmund, earl of Lancaster (b.1245), and Katharine who lived less than four years (1253-57).
Eleanor supervised the education of her son Edward, and watched over him, staying with him for three weeks when he was sick in 1246 in the Cistercian abbey at Beaulieu against Cistercian rules(!2). She was the designated keeper of castles for him if Henry died, and worked consistently for his interests, with the support of her Savoyard uncles, who played important roles in the English court in the 1240's and 1250's(!3).  Edward rebelled against his mother and her family for a time, but he came to respect her abilities and value her devotion during the struggle to retain royal power, and they remained on good terms for the rest of her life.
There were times when Eleanor had to negotiate between her uncle Boniface, archbishop of Canterbury, and her husband, but he and Peter of Savoy were strong and key supporters of Eleanor and the monarchy.  Howell describes Eleanor as a ""highly significant political figure in the struggle between the king and the baronage,"" noting that she ""encouraged the use of contingents of foreign knights to strengthen the royal power"" in times of crisis, that she ""gathered an army in the Low Countries, negotiated confidently with Louis IX of France and with the papacy, and by her energy and commitment helped to bring about the overthrow of Simon de Montfort and the rescue of her husband and eldest son from his control"" (xviii).

"80","Matilda of Scotland, queen of the English","","Queen Matilda (Edith) was the daughter of Margaret of Scotland and Malcolm Canmore, king of Scotland.  As the wife of Henry I, son of William the Conqueror, she was queen of England from 1100 to her death, and it was she who carried English royal blood, as a direct descendant of Alfred through her mother.  Both Orderic Vitalis (HE 8.22, 10.16) and William of Malmesbury (GR 2.470-71) note Margaret's royal descent; her grandfather was Edmund Ironside, halfbrother of Edward known as the Confessor.
Matilda and her sister Mary were educated under the tutelage of their mother's sister, abbess Christina, at Romsey and Wilton.  Matilda was rumored to have taken the veil, though Anselm was persuaded it was a false rumor when he agreed to marry her to Henry.  William of Malmesbury says she wore the veil to discourage suitors.  Marjorie Chibnall suggests it may have been her aunt's idea to have her wear a veil without taking vows, to protect her from abduction, (The Empress Matilda, Queen Consort, Queen Mother and Lady of the English (Oxford:  Blackwell, 1991), 7.  She was, however, devoted to religion and to Anselm as a spiritual advisor and friend, as well as to the needs of the kingdom, over which she served as regent when her husband was abroad.
Matilda's actions in that and other administrative capacities are mentioned in passing by Orderic (HE 6.10, 11.2).  Lois Huneycutt notes that Matilda not only participated in Henry's council, but chaired it in his absence, ""The Idea of the Perfect Princess:  The Life of St. Margaret in the Reign of Matilda II (1100-1118),"" Anglo-Norman Studies 12 (1989), 90.  Chibnall, 14, says that queen Matilda's correspondence with Anselm shows that her duties as queen came first, just as they did with her daughter the empress.  She bore two children, a son William who predeceased his father and a daughter Matilda, the empress, who became her father's heir and very nearly queen of England in her own right.
Matilda patronized churches and secular letters in Latin and French.  She commissioned at least two histories, a life of her mother, Margaret, from a monk of Durham, and an extended history of her family, the Gesta Regum Anglorum, from another monk William of Malmesbury, which was finished after her death and presented to her daughter, empress Matilda. Letters sent by the monks of Malmesbury to David, king of Scotland, queen Matilda's brother, and to the empress, her daughter, emphasize the queen's role in its composition, see Ewald Koensgen, ""Zwei unbekannte Briefe zu den Gesta Regum Anglorum des Wilhelm von Malmesbury,"" Deutsches Archiv fur Erforschung des Mittelalters 31 (1975), 205-14.  On the importance of women in the GRA, see Ferrante, To the Glory of Her Sex (Bloomington:  Indiana University, 1997), 100-03.
  William notes the queen's patronage of scholars, poets, and singers, though he thinks she favored foreigners at the cost of locals (5.418).  Benedeit dedicated the Voyage de saint Brendan to her and Philippe de Thaon the Livre de Sibylle.  M. Dominica Legge called Matilda the first known patron of French letters.  ""Son nom est le premier connu d'un patron des lettres francaises,"" in ""La precocite de la litterature anglo-normande,"" CCM 8 (1965), 329.

The bulk of Matilda's extant correspondence is with Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury and the ranking ecclesiastic of England, and an unusual number of the queen's letters to (and about) him survive.  The connection between them was both official by virtue of their offices, and personal in that he was a friend and spiritual advisor.  Anselm had performed her marriage ceremony and anointed her as queen, as she reminds him in ep.242, but his disputes over ecclesiastical jurisdiction first with Henry's brother, William Rufus, over vacant sees and simony, and then with Henry over lay investiture, kept him in exile on the continent for many years, and complicated his relations with Matilda as well.  Anselm went into exile in 1097 while William was king, was recalled by Henry in 1100, but went back into exile a second time, from 1103-06, during which Matilda continued to write to him and to plead his case.

Anselm had performed her marriage ceremony and anointed her as queen, as she reminds him in ep.242, but his disputes over ecclesiastical jurisdiction first with Henry's brother, William Rufus, over vacant sees and simony, and then with Henry over lay investiture, kept him in exile on the continent for many years, and complicated his relations with Matilda as well.  Anselm went into exile in 1097 while William was king, was recalled by Henry in 1100, but went back into exile a second time, from 1103-06, during which Matilda continued to write to him and to plead his case.

"69","Beatrice of Savoy","Countess and Marquise of Provence and Countess of Forcalquier and Gap","Beatrice of Savoy was the daughter of Count Thomas of Savoy, Marguis in Italy, and Margaret of Geneva.  She was one of ten known children, two girls and eight boys; six of her brothers lived long enough to become deeply involved in the politics of Europe.  Amadeus succeeded his father as Count of Savoy, William was bishop of Valence, Boniface became archbishop of Canterbury; Thomas was count of Flanders during his marriage to Joan of Flanders and then count in Piedmont, Peter became count of Savoy after the death of his nephew, and Philip I, who had been bishop of Valence and archbishop-elect of Lyon, succeeded his brother Peter as count of Savoy.(!1)
They were skilled leaders and diplomats, but their scope was greatly increased by the connections made for the family by the marriages of Beatrice's daughters.
With Raymond Berengar V, count of Provence, whom she married in 1219,(!2)Beatrice had four daughters, all destined to become queens, a phenomenon noted by Dante (Par. 6.133-35).  Matthew Paris called Beatrice a second Niobe (Chronica Majora, 3.335).  The oldest daughter, Marguerite, was married to Louis IX of France in 1234; the second, Eleanor, married Henry III of England in 1236; Sanchia married Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III, in 1243, and became Queen of the Romans when he was elected emperor in 1256; and the youngest daughter, Beatrice, her father's designated heir to Provence, married Charles of Anjou in 1246 and became Queen of Sicily and Naples in 1266.
Beatrice of Savoy was herself a skilled diplomat.  While she was in England for the marriage of her daughter Sanchia to Richard of Cornwall, she persuaded her son-in-law Henry III to grant his sister's husband, Simon de Montfort, a yearly stipend (500 marks) since there had been no marriage portion.  Henry also endowed Beatrice with an annual stipend of 400 pounds and agreed to loan her husband, for whom she was acting, 4000 marks on the security of five castles in Provence (Howell, 39, Cox, 120), which she would refuse to surrender to her son-in-law Charles until Henry released them in 1257.
But Beatrice was not only a diplomat; when the occasion demanded she was also a forceful ruler.  When various suitors tried to seize her daughter, the heir to Provence, Beatrice placed her in a safe fortress, secured the support of its people, and went to the pope for his protection.  When the pope turned to the Capetians to counter the moves of the Hohenstaufen, Beatrice agreed to the marriage of her daughter Beatrice with Charles of Anjou, brother of the king of France.  But he failed to respect her claims in Provence — her husband had left her the usufruct of the county for her lifetime — so Beatrice of Savoy (like her elder daughters) would be at odds with him for much of her life.  From her seat in Forcalquier and Gap, her mother-in-law's lands, which she inherited from her husband and ruled from 1245 to 1256, she formed ""the nucleus of a powerful anti-Angevin party"" (Cox, 160).  In 1255, when her brother Thomas was captured by citizens of Asti, she closed the Piedmont routes through her territory and arrested the ""Lombards"" who came through (Cox, 257).  When a family member was not threatened, however, Beatrice was concerned about improving travel conditions in the Alps in lands left to her by her mother, and like her brother Boniface, left money in her will for bridge and road construction and repair (Viard, document 17).
The problems with Charles were resolved in stages.  In 1248, in return for one-third the normal revenues of the comital treasury, Beatrice agreed to forego her claims on both usufruct of the county and on payment of arrears, and Charles promised to oblige his officers to swear to honor the commitments.  All county officers were to render their accounts to her and to auditors to be selected by her and Charles (Cox, 162, Viard, documents 6,7).  But Beatrice did not think Charles' officers respected the treaty.  It was only after she had spent some time in the French court that she agreed to a large payment in return for surrendering her territories in Provence, but not trusting Charles, she insisted the money be paid through his brother king Louis (Cox, 281).  At the same time, she promised to free the ""Lombards"" she still held, and Charles promised to pardon her supporters.  The two swore to the stipulations in 1257.
In 1258, Beatrice's mother Margaret of Geneva died, leaving her daughter all her possessions in the Alps and Beatrice took up residence in Menuet with a large entourage.  She founded a hospital at Les Echelles for the knights of St. John of Jerusalem to care for the poor and left money to almshouses and hospitals and for the repair of roads and bridges as well as to retainers and relatives.
Beatrice commissioned a text, the Régime du corps from Aldobrandino of Siena in 1256, which includes two chapters on pediatrics (Howell, 3).  Aimeric de Belenoi, Sordello, Giraut de Borneil, and Elias de Barjols wrote lyrics for her.  Cox describes her as ""a handsome and strong-willed woman"" who attained an international position ""that was the fruit of energy and intelligence,"" not just the result of her daughters' brilliant marriages (454).","(!1)For information about the family in Europe, see Eugene L.

"78","Blanche of Navarre, Countess of Champagne","Countess of Champagne","Blanche of Navarre (c.1181-1229), countess of Champagne was the daughter of Sancho VI el Sabio, king of Navarre and Sancha of Castile; her older sister, Berengaria, had been queen of England as the wife of Richard I.  Blanche was also related to the French royal family:  her first cousin Alfonso VIII, son of her maternal uncle Sancho of Castile, married Eleanor of England and their daughter Blanche married Louis VIII of France.  Thus countess Blanche was the French queen's first cousin once removed.  Both Blanches served as regents for their sons and their relation seems to have been close.
Blanche of Navarre was married in 1199 to Thibaut III, a grandson of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII, and thus a nephew of Louis's successor, Philip Augustus.  Thibaut's father, Henry I (the Liberal), had married Marie of France, daughter of Eleanor and Louis; their older son Henry II left for Jerusalem in 1190, leaving Champagne to his younger brother Thibaut III.1  Henry married the queen of Jerusalem with whom he had two daughters; he died in 1197.  The king, Philip II, confirmed Thibaut's succession (Thibaut was 18), but Thibaut himself died in 1201, leaving his widow Blanche with a young daughter and pregnant with their son, Thibaut IV.  Blanche went to Philip and did homage for her right of wardship and her dower, according to Evergates the first homage ever rendered by a countess.
Blanche was regent for her son from 1201-22.2  Henry's daughter by Isabel of Jerusalem, Philippa, and her husband Erard of Brienne, from an important family in Champagne, challenged the claim of Thibaut and Blanche in 1213.  The cardinal legate and several Champagne barons declared for Thibaut; the king, archbishops of Reims and Sens, bishops of Langres, Chalons, and Autun, the duke of Burgundy and the count of Nevers all accepted Thibaut's homage for Champagne lands held from them (Evergates, Feudal Society, 161).  Blanche had earlier obtained the king's promise to defer any challenge to the succession and she now succeeded in getting ecclesiastical support, declaring both Henry II's marriage invalid and Erard and Philippa within the prohibited degrees of relation (Evergates, ""Aristocratic Women,"" 83).  Philippa was bought off with 5000 L cash and an annual rent of 1,200 L.
The papacy supported Blanche3 and when Erard and his supporters rebelled in 1216 the emperor Fredrick II helped her militarily.  The rebels were defeated; Blanche herself led her army to Nancy and burned the town.4  Geoffroy of Villehardouin and Milo Breban (officials of Champagne who were serving the Frankish empire in Constantinople) advised her when she ran into trouble during the regency; she asked them for information about the status of great barons and they suggested she consult the scripta feodorum (lists of fief holders and obligations, not systematic at that point) to learn their obligations.  Their response is cited in part in Evergates, Feudal Society, 213, fn.17, from a letter that has not been dated:   ""Intimamus vobis preterea quod scripta feodorum vestrorum sunt in ecclesia Sancti Stephani Trecarum ... ad tradendum vero scripta feodorum in ecclesia Beati Stephani, ego Milo Brebanus interfui, et comes Henricus secum tulit exemplarium ultra mare.""  ""We make known to you, moreover, that the records of your fiefs are in the church of St. Stephen of Troyes ... I, Milo Brebanus, was present at the handing over of those records in the church of St. Stephen, and count Henry took the copy with him overseas.""  Evergates comments that ""there may have been a conspiracy to keep the countess unaware of the existence or whereabouts of the document.""  The Feoda, which were referred to when oral testimony was in doubt, began in 1172; four were attempted during Blanche's regency but survive only as fragmentary registers.
Blanche had established her rule early when many barons were away on the Fourth Crusade, and she continued her husband's efforts to expand comital influence, exacting oaths of loyalty, imposing homage on younger sons, installing castles (see Evergates, ""Aristocratic Women,"" 82).  With the assent of a baronial assembly she had convened in 1212, she established procedures for daughters, rather than the closest male relative, to inherit castles and fortified residences if their fathers died without a son (Evergates, ""Aristocratic Women,"" 84-85); the agreement is also recorded in Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Histoire des Ducs et des Comtes de Champagne, v. 5 (Paris:  Aug. Durand, 1863), #814. Arbois de Jubainville, (who gives a detailed summary of Blanche's regency in v.4, 101-97), records and briefly summarizes the contents of 869 documents from the regency of Blanche de Navarre, (1201 to 1220), until Thibaut ""left his mother's tutelage"" (#1420, p.180), beginning with the promises she made to Philip-Augustus, king of France (#550), his certification of her dower (#551), and acceptance of her hommage (#552), after her husband's death.  
There is great variety among the documents:  Blanche issues charters to towns and monks and receives hommage for various holdings.  (Even towards the end of her regency, people are referred to as ""vassals,"" ""liege men"" of Blanche and Thibaut, not of Thibaut alone, #1216, 1218.)  She makes payments, exchanges serfs, declares, confirms, approves donations and transactions, some concluded in her presence, of various kinds involving religious and/or laymen, e.g. money for rights to woods, sales by churches.  She mediates, investigates and settles disputed claims (e.g., has the limits' of an abbey's woods determined and delivers judgment enjoining the abbey to accept those limits, #768); she arbitrates between a convent and an abbey (#1166).  In other cases, a bishop adjudicates a dispute she has with an abbey, #778), the duke of Burgundy one she has with a bishop (#807).  Pope Honorius charges the prior of Saint-Martin des Champs and canons of Paris to judge a dispute between Blanche of Navarre and the abbey of Cluny on the rights of entry of wines and other matters (#1043), and a dispute between Blanche and the abbey of Pontigny and some priests of dioceses of Sens, Auxerre, and Troyes who claimed Blanche was responsible for beasts that her enemies had carried off (#1056).
The countess authorizes work on a fortress (#1175), the creation of prebends in her chapel (#801); she shares expenses with monks to build mills (#630), oversees loan repayments to ""her"" Jews (#560), buys the rights to Jews in Ervy (#886).  She joins with the bishop of Meaux to make money (#695), redeems a village that had been part of her dower which had been given away by her husband without her consent (#604).  She receives income from annual fairs and reparation from nuns for having elected an abbess without her consent (1347).  She renounces claims to wood-mote (gruerie) in favor of an abbey.  
The regulations she promulgates for the administration of Hotel-Dieu-le-Comte of Troyes are, according to the editor, the oldest known French charter for Champagne (#812).5  Philip Augustus sends new regulations about fighting instruments to Blanche to execute in her realm (#926).  She and duke Eudes of Burgundy suspend travel between their lands in 1215 (#928) and make an alliance to conquer Burgundy, agreeing to divide the expenses and the conquered land in 1216 (#1010).  When a bishop suspends a prior and various other monks from their offices, he asks the countess to send agents to administer the temporal affairs of the monastery (#957).  
In 1222 Blanche retired to Argensolles, a large Cistercian convent with authority to accept 90 women, which she had received special permission to found (Evergates, ""Aristocratic Women,"" 84).  Blanche had had good relations with Cluny and the Cistercians;  she received the right to participate like a nun in Cluny's spiritual favors (Arbois de Jubainville, #617) and to be treated like a member of the Cistercian order after her death (#974).

"92","Judith of Bavaria, Empress","Empress","Judith's father was Welf, a noble Bavarian, her mother Heilwig, a noble Saxon (who became abbess of Chelles after the death of Welf.  Judith was married to Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, in 819, after the death of his first wife I/Ermentrude, with whom he had had three sons.  He is said to have selected her at a gathering of noble women at Aachen.  Elizabeth Ward suggests that the marriage brought Louis useful support from the east.(1)  They had two children, Gisela in 821 and Charles the Bald in 823. Judith died at Tours in 841, Louis died in 840.  
Judith’s sister Emma was married to Louis the German, a son of Louis the Pious from his first marriage.  Her brothers were Conrad and Rudolf of Burgundy, who came to Louis's court with her and were captured, tonsured, and sent as prisoners to her stepson Pepin when Louis's older sons rebelled.(2)  Ward notes that Judith and Emma both requested their husbands to patronize Corvey in Saxony,    indicating that the siblings shared some purposes.  Judith's involvement in patronage is indicated in two letters of Lupus of Ferriere to her son Charles after her death:  ""Your Highness's father, at the request of your mother of honored memory, the empress Judith, presented the cell of Saint Josse to the monastery of Ferrieres"" ep.42; and ""Indeed it was through the intercession of your glorious mother that your most honorable father, the Emperor Louis, for the healing of his soul ... had given this subsidiary to our monastery"" ep.49.(3)  Bishop Aldric also commemorated Judith's generosity to churches in a poem:

Huic regina potens Iudith cognomine dicta
Mirifici calicis aurea dona dedit,
Obtulit hunc sancti mox salvatoris ad aram
Ac sanctae Mariae, martyris et Stephani.(4)

The powerful queen, called Judith by name,
gave gold gifts of a wonderful chalice,
she offered it now to the altar of the holy savior
and of Saint Mary, and the martyr Stephen.

Louis was devoted to Judith who, after the birth of her son, did all she could to assure that Charles would have his share of power after Louis’s death.  There were already rivalries among Louis’s other sons, but the birth of Charles complicated matters for him and his mother.(5)  In 829 Louis retired Lothar to Italy and endowed Charles with territory based on the Welf family lands in Alemannia; in 830 Lothar, Pepin, and Louis of Bavaria marched against Louis, but failed to force him to abdicate though they succeeded in putting Judith into a monastery (Saint Radegund of Poitiers).   Within a year, Louis restored his power, sent Lothar back to Italy and brought Judith back to court, but the rebellions of his sons continued, and Louis was forced to surrender to his sons.  He and Charles were imprisoned, but Lothar’s terms were so harsh that in 834 Louis the Bavarian, Pepin and other magnates released both of them and from then on, Louis was recognized as emperor, outside Italy.
In an attempt to rid the king and court of Judith’s influence, her enemies (her stepsons and their lay and clerical supporters) accused her of adultery, incest, and witchcraft with her supposed lover, Count Bernard of Septimania.  When Louis resisted the charges, they forcibly placed her in a convent, twice, but Louis rescued her. In 830, however, he was compelled to find her guilty, and had to promise to enter a monastery since repudiation was now frowned on, but with the help of his supporters he had her swear an oath to her innocence and reinstated her.(6)    After Louis’s death, Judith’s enemies persuaded her son Charles of her guilt and he deprived her of her holdings.  
While she was empress, various works were dedicated to or complimented Judith:  Ermold Nigellus, ""In Honorem Ludovici,"" and ""De ordine palatii""; Walafrid Strabo, ""De imagine Tetrici,"" and poems; Freculf of Lisieux, the second volume of his world history, Chronicon.  Rabanus Maurus dedicated two biblical commentaries of Judith, one on the book of Judith, the other on Esther, ""one your equal in name, the other in dignity.""  The writers who supported her compared her to Rachel, Miriam, and Bathsheba, as well as Judith as Esther; those who opposed her saw her as another Eve (Paschasius Radbertus, life of Wala), Jezebel, and Delilah (Agobard of Lyons, Two Books in Favor of the Sons and Against Judith the Wife of Louis), see Stafford, 19. 

Judith appears in various scenes in Ermoldus’s In Honorem Ludovici:  at the baptism of the visiting Harold king of the Danes and his wife, Judith (pulcra induperatrix, “the beautiful empress” l.2240) as her godmother raises the queen from the fount, clothes her and gives her rich gifts.(7)  There is a procession in which the empress and her young son shine, and a banquet in which the emperor seats her beside him and she kisses his knees 92354-55).  At a hunt the empress appears on horseback beautiful and magnificently arrayed (pulcherrima conjunx Caesaris, ornata comptaque mirifice, 2378-79) and keeps her eager young son from chasing a young deer but not from striking it when it is brought to him.  Judith (prudenter) has had a shelter of greens and cloths built for the hunters and has ordered a meal to be served. 
At the end, the exiled poet asks the emperor and then the empress to have mercy on the exiled poet:
Tu quoque, digna sibi conjux, pulcherrima Judith,
Quae secum imperii culmina jure tenes,
Confer opem lapso, allisum solare misellum,
Erige labentem, carcere solve reum,
Ut vos Altitonans per plurima tempora saecli
Sublimet, salvet, ditet, honoret, amet. (2644-49)

You too, his worthy spouse, most beautiful Judith,
who by right holds the heights of empire with him,
confer wealth on the fallen one, console the poor damaged one,
raise the fallen, loose the guilty from prison,
so that the thunderer from on high may for many years
exalt, save, enrich, honor, and love you.

Walafrid Strabo also describes Judith in a poem for the court in “De imagine Tetrici,” as a Rachel leading her only son, as a Judith (non frustra nomine Iudith, 192:  “not wrongly named Judith”) who saved her people by destroying their enemy and played sweet music, as a learned gifted Sappho and Holda and then he addresses her directly:

Quicquid enim tibimet sexus subtraxit egestas,
Reddidit ingeniis culta atque exercita vita.
In qua multa simul nobis miranda videmus;
Semine stat locuples, apparet dogmate dives,
Est ratione potens, est cum pietate pudica,
Dulcis amore, valens animo, sermone faceta:
Laeta cubans, sit laeta sedens, sit laeta resurgens,
Laeteturque poli felix in sede locata, 201-08.(8) 

Whatever the deficiency of sex took away from you,
an educated and disciplined life gave back to your natural capacity.
In which we see many things to be admired by us;
opulent in seed, rich in dogma she appears,
she is powerful in reason, chaste with piety, 
sweet in love, valiant in spirit, eloquent in speech:
reclining happy, may she be happy sitting, may she be happy rising,
and made happy when she is placed in the seat of heaven.

","","","841","Judith of Bavaria, Empress Empress Judith's father was Welf, a noble Bavarian, her mother Heilwig, a noble Saxon (who became abbess of Chelles after the death of Welf.  Judith was married to Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, in 819, after the death of his first wife I/Ermentrude, with whom he had had three sons.  He is said to have selected her at a gathering of noble women at Aachen.  Elizabeth Ward suggests that the marriage brought Louis useful support from the east.(1)  They had two children, Gisela (in 821) and Charles the Bald (in 823).  Judith died at Tours in 841, Louis died in 840.  
Judith’s sister Emma was married to Louis the German, a son of Louis the Pious from his first marriage.  Her brothers were Conrad and Rudolf of Burgundy, who came to Louis's court with her and were captured, tonsured, and sent as prisoners to her stepson Pepin when Louis's older sons rebelled.(2)  Ward notes that Judith and Emma both requested their husbands to patronize Corvey in Saxony,    indicating that the siblings shared some purposes.  Judith's involvement in patronage is indicated in two letters of Lupus of Ferriere to her son Charles after her death:  ""Your Highness's father, at the request of your mother of honored memory, the empress Judith, presented the cell of Saint Josse to the monastery of Ferrieres"" ep.42; and ""Indeed it was through the intercession of your glorious mother that your most honorable father, the Emperor Louis, for the healing of his soul ... had given this subsidiary to our monastery"" ep.49.(3)
Louis was devoted to Judith who, after the birth of her son, did all she could to assure that Charles would have his share of power after Louis’s death.  There were already rivalries among Louis’s other sons, but the birth of Charles complicated matters for him and his mother.(4)  In 829 Louis retired Lothar to Italy and endowed Charles with territory based on the Welf family lands in Alemannia; in 830 Lothar, Pepin, and Louis of Bavaria marched against Louis, but failed to force him to abdicate though they succeeded in putting Judith into a monastery (Saint Radegund of Poitiers).   Within a year, Louis restored his power, sent Lothar back to Italy and brought Judith back to court, but the rebellions of his sons continued, and Louis was forced to surrender to his sons.  He and Charles were imprisoned, but Lothar’s terms were so harsh that in 834 Louis the Bavarian, Pepin and other magnates released both of them and from then on, Louis was recognized as emperor, outside Italy.
In an attempt to rid the king and court of Judith’s influence, her enemies (her stepsons and their lay and clerical supporters) accused her of adultery, incest, and witchcraft with her supposed lover, Count Bernard of Septimania.  When Louis resisted the charges, they forcibly placed her in a convent, twice, but Louis rescued her. In 830, however, he was compelled to find her guilty, and had to promise to enter a monastery since repudiation was now frowned on, but with the help of his supporters he had her swear an oath to her innocence and reinstated her.(5)    After Louis’s death, Judith’s enemies persuaded her son Charles of her guilt and he deprived her of her holdings.  
While she was empress, various works were dedicated to or complimented Judith:  Ermold Nigellus, ""In Honorem Ludovici,"" and ""De ordine palatii""; Walafrid Strabo, ""De imagine Tetrici,"" and poems; Freculf of Lisieux, the second volume of his world history, Chronicon.  Rabanus Maurus dedicated two biblical commentaries of Judith, one on the book of Judith, the other on Esther, ""one your equal in name, the other in dignity.""  The writers who supported her compared her to Rachel, Miriam, and Bathsheba, as well as Judith as Esther.  Those who opposed her saw her as another Eve (Paschasius Radbertus, life of Wala), Jezebel, and Delilah (Agobard of Lyons, Two Books in Favor of the Sons and Against Judith the Wife of Louis), see Stafford, 19.

The fact that the letter he sent her has several richly coloured initial capitals may also suggest that she was a person of some prestige.   Otherwise all we know is that she was probably a nun in the Benedictine abbey of Malling in Kent,1  and was identified with Darenth,  which the editor of Osbert’s letters, E.W. Williamson identifies as  a small village on the river of that name, three miles above Dartford.

"33","Eustochium","","Julia Eustochium was the third daughter born to Paula and Toxotius.  Her mother had adopted an ascetic life after the death of her husband and Eustochium, still quite young and a virgin, joined her in it.  Jerome speaks of her having been trained in Marcella's cell, ep.127, and calls her a ""paragon of virgins.""  Despite the attempts of her paternal (and pagan) uncle and aunt to draw her into the life of a rich aristocrat, she chose to remain a virgin and dedicated herself to a religious life, when she was 14 or 15.  Jerome encouraged her in that choice and wrote her a treatise on preserving virginity (ep.22). (!1)
Eustochium was trained in Latin and Greek and learned Hebrew, like her mother, to study the bible and work with Jerome on his translations.  She accompanied her mother Paula to the Holy Land following Jerome in 385 and once they had settled in Bethlehem after visiting many holy sites, she lived there for the rest of her life.  As Jerome had commented about them to another virgin in their circle, Asella, when he left Rome, Paula and Eustochium, ""whether the world likes it or not, belong to me in Christ,"" ep.45.  Paula died in 404, but Eustochium stayed, running their convent, by now home to fifty women, and working with Jerome until she died.  Her niece, the younger Paula, joined her aunt perhaps in 410 and she remained with Jerome until his death.  Jerome wrote many of his translations from Hebrew and commentaries on books of the old and new testament for Paula and her daughter, and after Paula died he continued to write for Eustochium.
Jerome sent greetings from the two younger women to Augustine in 416:  ""Your holy and venerable daughters, Eustochium and Paula, are progressing in a manner worthy of their own rank and your encouragement, and they send special greetings to your blessedness"" (ep.134).  When followers of Pelagius violently attacked the Latin monasteries at Bethlehem in 416, Pope Innocent I wrote to John of Jerusalem at the behest of the two women: ""the most noble virgins of great clemency, Paula and Eustochium, deplored the plundering, slaughter, arson, and every outrage perpetrated against the places of your church by the devil,"" PL 20 c.601.  They and Jerome had to leave their monasteries for a short while, but were able to return.
Jerome wrote to his friend Pammachius after the death in 395 of his wife Paulina, Eustochium's sister, (ep.66) praising the women of the family:  Eustochium harvests the flowers of virginity, Paula rubs the laborious threshing-floor of widowhood, Paulina preserves the chaste bed of matrimony (66.2), and Pammachius joined them, making a ""quadriga,"" a team of four horses from one house, which Jerome connects with the cardinal virtues, Pammachius with prudence, Paula with justice, the virgin with fortitude and the wife with temperance (66.3).  Jerome divides the family group of five into the two who have died, Paulina and Blesilla, and the three who will fly together to Christ, Paula, and Eustochium, with Pammachius between them (66.15).  But Jerome adds even if you did all I said, you would be conquered by Paula and Eustochium, if not in deed then in sex (66.13).
Only three letters from Jerome to Eustochium are to be found in his collected letters, the one on virginity, ep.22, a thank-you note for gifts she had sent, ep.31, and a eulogy of her dead mother, Paula, ep.108.  Jerome says, in De viris illustribus, ch.135, that he wrote to Paula and Eustochium every day while they were in Bethlehem.  Those letters are not extant, but the prologues attached to the works and sometimes to the individual parts of the works he did for them are, and they constitute a fair-sized body of correspondence.  Only one letter from Eustochium and her mother is extant, the one inviting Marcella to visit them in the Holy Land, which may be primarily the work of Paula (though, of course, it has also been attributed to Jerome).  (!2)
After Eustochium died, Jerome described his enormous sense of loss to his friends:  to Riparius, ""the sudden dormition/death of the venerable holy virgin of Christ Eustochium saddened me greatly and utterly changed the state of our life, since we cannot do many things we want to and the weakness of old age conquers the mind's ardor,"" ep.151; to Donatus, ""the dormition of the holy and venerable lady Eustochium has violently saddened us, who as you know gave up her spirit in that ardor of confession and preferred to leave her home and familiar things and endure honorable exile rather than be stained by intercourse with heretics,"" ep.154. (!3)

(!2) J.N.D. Kelly says the letter was ""written in the name of Paula and her daughter but manifestly by Jerome himself,"" though he gives no reason for the judgment, Jerome, His Life, Writings, and Controversies (New York:  Harper and Row, 1975), 141.  Since Marcella knew all of them so well, it is hard to imagine why they would have bothered with such a subterfuge.

Jerome wrote to his friend Pammachius after the death in 395 of his wife Paulina, Eustochium's sister, (ep.66) praising the women of the family:  Eustochium harvests the flowers of virginity, Paula rubs the laborious threshing-floor of widowhood, Paulina preserves the chaste bed of matrimony (66.2), and Pammachius joined them, making a ""quadriga,"" a team of four horses from one house, which Jerome connects with the cardinal virtues, Pammachius with prudence, Paula with justice, the virgin with fortitude and the wife with temperance (66.3).  Jerome divides the family group of five into the two who have died, Paulina and Blesilla, and the three who will fly together to Christ, Paula, and Eustochium, with Pammachius between them (66.15).  But Jerome adds even if you did all I said, you would be conquered by Paula and Eustochium, if not in deed then in sex (66.13).
Only three letters from Jerome to Eustochium are to be found in his collected letters, the one on virginity, ep.22, a thank-you note for gifts she had sent, ep.31, and a eulogy of her dead mother, Paula, ep.108.  Jerome says, in De viris illustribus, ch.135, that he wrote to Paula and Eustochium every day while they were in Bethlehem.  Those letters are not extant, but the prologues attached to the works and sometimes to the individual parts of the works he did for them are, and they constitute a fair-sized body of correspondence.  Only one letter from Eustochium and her mother is extant, the one inviting Marcella to visit them in the Holy Land, which may be primarily the work of Paula (though, of course, it has also been attributed to Jerome).  (!2)
After Eustochium died, Jerome described his enormous sense of loss to his friends:  to Riparius, ""the sudden dormition/death of the venerable holy virgin of Christ Eustochium saddened me greatly and utterly changed the state of our life, since we cannot do many things we want to and the weakness of old age conquers the mind's ardor,"" ep.151; to Donatus, ""the dormition of the holy and venerable lady Eustochium has violently saddened us, who as you know gave up her spirit in that ardor of confession and preferred to leave her home and familiar things and endure honorable exile rather than be stained by intercourse with heretics,"" ep.154. (!3)

 (!1) Jerome mentions this letter in the list he gives of his works in Liber de viris illustribus, ch.135,  PL23, c.758, ""ad Eustochium de virginitate servanda.""
(!2) J.N.D. Kelly says the letter was ""written in the name of Paula and her daughter but manifestly by Jerome himself,"" though he gives no reason for the judgment, Jerome, His Life, Writings, and Controversies (New York:  Harper and Row, 1975), 141.  Since Marcella knew all of them so well, it is hard to imagine why they would have bothered with such a subterfuge.

"107","Joan of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders","Countess of Flanders","Joan, Jeanne, was the daughter of Baldwin IX Count of Flanders and Hainaut, first Latin Emperor of Constantinople, and Marie de Champagne (daughter of Henry the Liberal of Champagne and Marie of France).  Marie died in 1204, Baldwin in 1205, as a captive in Bulgaria after a military defeat, leaving Joan and her much younger sister Marguerite as his heirs.  They were turned over to the custody of the French king, Philip II Augustus by their uncle Philip the Noble of Namur, who ruled as regent in Joan’s name.  In 1211/12 Joan was married to Fernand/Ferrand of Portugal, son of King Sancho I.  Fernand made concessions of land to the French king, Aire and St. Omer, which Philip’s son Louis had taken, claiming it as part of his mother’s dowry (Isabel of Hainaut).  That annoyed the Flemish who refused to recognize Fernand as their count.  Turned off from the French by Louis’s aggression, and attracted by the financial benefits of wool trade with England, Fernand made an alliance with John, king of England, Otto IV, and counts of Holland and Boulogne.  When France’s intended attack on England was thwarted by the pope removing the interdict against John, Philip Augustus turned his large fleet against Flanders.  Flanders was defeated at Bouvines in 1214, Lille was destroyed, Gand, Ypres and Bruges, burned, and Fernand was captured and imprisoned in Paris.  He would remain in captivity until 1227, while Joan ruled Flanders and worked to have him released.  She was prepared to make many concessions and pay a large ransom for which she borrowed at high rates, but Flemish town councils rejected the terms of release.  She also applied to the pope and various bishops to press for Fernand’s release, but Philip Augustus was intransigent.  After he died, his son Louis VIII continued to hold Fernand, setting harsh conditions for his release in the treaty in Melun, which Joan agreed to but the Flemish barons and cities rejected.  It was only after Louis’s death that his queen, Blanche of Castile, regent for Louis IX, agreed to less stringent terms and half the ransom, and Fernand was finally released in 1227.  Joan named powerful nobles as bailiff during Ferrand’s imprisonment, John of Nesle to 1224, Arnold of Oudenaarde from 1224-27, and later Thierry of Beveren from 1233-37.  John of Nesle was the choice of the French king, but Joan bought him off in 1224, paying 23,545 parisian pounds for the castellany of Bruges, and he returned to his French lands.  Arnold supported her against the man who surfaced in 1225, claiming to be her father Baldwin who stirred up a lot of trouble before he was unmasked by an investigation at the French court.  The false Baldwin escaped but was recaptured and executed in 1225, after which Joan granted amnesty to the cities that had believed his story.  Frederick II, who had supported France against England and his own rival Otto, confiscated imperial Flanders at a diet in Frankfort, 1218, and granted William count of Holland the parts held from the empire, since Joan had not done homage to the empire for Flanders.  But she argued successfully that the roads were too dangerous for a woman to travel while her husband was imprisoned.  In 1221, Frederick’s son Henry VII confirmed the countess in possessn of the imperial fiefs and forced the count of Holland to submit and recognize his dependence on Flanders.  
Joan’s policy was to increase the municipal powers of the towns to counterbalance the powerful barons, some of whom had fought on the French side at Bouvines.  She granted charters encouraging local government, markets, canal construction, and the wool trade, and allowing the installation of aldermen.  She also supported religious establishments, among them houses for Cistercian and Dominican women and supported the Beguines, building them a substantial home in Bruges.  When Fernand returned to Flanders, he joined Joan in support of municipal power and the establishment of charitable and pious foundations.  His release may have been hastened by the proposal of the Duke of Brittany to the pope that he allow Joan to divorce Fernand and marry him, not an appealing prospect for the king of France.  Fernand died in 1233 and Joan ruled alone again until 1236, when she married Thomas of Savoy, then 37, uncle of the French queen Marguerite of Provence. Joan had had a daughter with Fernand, but she died in 1234.  With the agreement of Joan’s sister and heir, Marguerite, Thomas was granted a life pension of 6000 Artois pounds to be collected from Flanders, if Joan predeceased him childless.  Marguerite later redeemed the pension for 60,000 pounds.  When Joan and Thomas went to Compiegne to do hommage to Louis in December 1237, the French king insisted that Thomas swear to the treaty of Melun before the hommage, but Thomas said he could act as count of Flanders until he had done hommage and an arbitration panel of three peers found for him.  More cities were granted municipal rights between 1239 and 1241, Damme, Caprick (added to Gand, Bruges, Ypres, Lille, Douai, Seclin), all without revolt.  Joan spent much of her time in her last years in abbey of Marquette where she was buried next to her first husband Fernand and her daughter.  She dictated her will in the presence of Thomas of Savoy, her sister Marguerite, and many others in December 4, 1244, and died the next day.1

Otherwise, we know only that she was involved in a lengthy dispute with a priest, Roger of Ingatestone, over some tithes, and that she had an administrative official, Hugh, whose presence or actions (perhaps in support of her dispute) brought down the wrath of archbishop Theobald of Canterbury on the abbess in the mid 1150’s.  At the same time, she received Osbert of Clare as a guest at the abbey, and he wrote an elaborate work in praise of chastity for her.  Osbert’s two neices, Margaret and Cecilia, were at Barking.
Barking abbey was home to women of the high aristocracy.  The abbess was an eminent figure, ranking as a baron ex officio. its abbesses appointed by the king.

"74","Agnes of Prague","","Agnes of Prague, (1211-1282), was the youngest daughter of King Premysl Otakar I and Queen Constance of Hungary. Agnes's mother was a sister to Andrew II of Hungary, the father of Saint Elizabeth. Constance was the second wife of Otakar; the first, Adele, was the daughter of the margrave of Meissen. Otakar and Adele had four children. As time passed, Otakar grew tired of Adele preferring the younger Constance. He used the fact that Adele was a distant relative as grounds for dispensation, and convinced Bishop Daniel of Prague to annul the marriage. Adele appealed to Pope Innocent III, but died before the matter was settled. Constance and Otakar had nine children. Otakar's oldest living son from this second marriage, Wenceslas I, became his successor . \r\nAgnes's father was a master politician who secured for Bohemia its hereditary dynasty. Anxious to expand and protect his kingdom, Otakar betrothed his daughters diplomatically. At the age of three, Agnes was sent to Silesia with her older sister, Anna, who was to be engaged to Henry II, son of the duke of Silesia. \r\nAnna and Agnes were placed under the care of their aunt, Duchess (Saint) Hedwig of Silesia (1174-1243). Hedwig arranged that the young Agnes be cared for by the Cistercian nuns of Trebnitz. Anna stayed in Silesia and was married to Henry II in 1216. \r\nUpon her return to Prague, Agnes was sent to the Premonstratensian convent of Doxany in Bohemia. In 1143, this convent had been founded by Queen Gertrude, Agnes's grandmother, for the purpose of educating daughters of the aristocracy. Its nuns were daughters of the highest nobility, and the convent was known for its pedagogical excellence. It was here that Agnes learned to read. \r\nSometime during 1219-1220, Agnes was betrothed to Henry VII, son of the German emperor Frederick II. Since Henry was in residence with Duke Leopold VI of Austria, Agnes was sent to Vienna to begin her formation as queen. Taking advantage of changing political situations, Leopold VI, however, undermined Otakar's agreement with Frederick and negotiated a wedding between his own daughter Margaret and Henry. This arrangement threatened Otakar's regional dominance and offset the delicate political equilibrium in Europe. Agnes returned to Bohemia and Otakar declared war on the duke of Austria. Although Otakar I negotiated an armistice with the Austrian duke, the Bohemian/ Austrian conflict continued during the reigns of Otakar's successors. \r\nMeanwhile, Agnes was designing a plan of her own. The Franciscan spirit was welcomed not only by Agnes, but also by a substantial number of the royal family of Premyslids, including Agnes's cousin, Elizabeth of Hungary. In Eastern Europe, the Franciscan movement initially had its greatest impact on the upper classes of society, a phenomena opposite that which happened in Italy.\r\nAfter the marriage between Henry VII and Leopold of Austria's daughter Margaret, Otakar focused his efforts toward obtaining a political alliance with England, again taking advantage of Agnes's marriageable status. Talks began which proposed Henry III, king of England, as a possible suitor for Agnes. These negotiations proceeded slowly perhaps because of Agnes's reluctance, and also perhaps because Otakar preferred to wait for a more advantageous political alliance. \r\nIn 1231, Emperor Frederick II, who had been recently widowed, asked for Agnes's hand in marriage. At this last proposal, Agnes appealed to Pope Gregory IX. In the end, her brother, King Wenceslas I rejected the emperor's request. The Legend of Agnes of Prague 2:2, describes the dynamics of the scene: \r\nAnd in order that she might more surely persevere in her resolution, which she conceived through God's inspiration, putting her hand to strong things, through trustworthy and discreet messengers, she made known her intention to the noble vicar of Christ, the Lord Pope Gregory IX. This felicitous pope rejoiced at the most generous devotion of the virgin, encouraged her by his gracious letter which he sent back by the same messengers, commended and confirmed her holy resolution, and with many spiritual gifts invited her to be his adopted daughter and accorded her his devoted paternal affection all the rest of his days. \r\nThe daughter of Christ was filled with spiritual consolation by these things that she received by way of reply from the High Pontiff, and immediately, fearlessly explained her resolution to her brother the Lord King Wenceslas I. When the king heard this, he was not without great anxiety, as would be expected, about how to excuse himself, and he dispatched messengers to disclose to the emperor what his sister had resolved to do.\r\nIt is said that the emperor replied to their message in the following manner: ""If this affront had been committed against us by any man, under no condition would we desist from avenging the insult of such contempt. However, since she has rather chosen a Lord who is greater than we, we do not consider this to be any insult against us, for we believe that this thing has been done through divine inspiration."" Therefore, with words of praise he highly extolled the virgin's good intention and sent her rich gifts and many relics, exhorting her to bring to a fruitful end what she had happily begun. \r\nOn November 17, 1231, Agnes's cousin Elizabeth of Hungary, who was only a few years older than Agnes, died at the age of twenty-four. Elizabeth's care of famine victims, her founding of a hospital out of her own modest means for the poor and sick (1228), and many other stories concerning Elizabeth's saintly generosity were well known to Agnes. Elizabeth was canonized by Gregory IX on May 25, 1235. \r\nIn 1233, Agnes followed Elizabeth's example by establishing a hospital. The building of hospitals for the merciful care of the poor, abandoned, and ill, especially the incurable lepers, was common to the penitential spirit. Agnes placed the care of this hospital in the hands of a pious lay brotherhood, the Crosiers of the Red Star, who organized themselves with the help of the Friars Minor. This brotherhood was the first religious Order native to Bohemia and already in Agnes's lifetime extended its network of social outreach beyond the borders of Bohemia. \r\nAgnes also built a monastery for women and a convent for the friars who would serve as its chaplains. She sent messengers to Rome asking for papal approval for her monastery and requested sisters who followed the form of life of the Poor Sisters of San Damiano. With Gregory IX's approval, Clare sent Agnes five sisters from Trent. Since Trent was part of the Austrian Tyrol, these sisters spoke German, a language commonly understood in Prague. \r\nOn June 11, 1234, at the age of twenty-three, Agnes entered the Monastery of the Most Holy Redeemer. Seven bishops officiated and Agnes's brother, King Wenceslas I, and the queen were present for the historic event. \r\nHer role as abbess of this monastery brought her early difficulties with Gregory IX over the question of poverty. With Cum relicta saeculi (May 18, 1235), Gregory IX established Agnes's monastery as the beneficiary of the revenues that Agnes had handed over to the Hospital of Saint Francis. This violated the Franciscan ideal of living without property that was so dear to the hearts of the earliest Franciscans. After Agnes leveled a series of protests, the pope retracted and entrusted the direction and revenue of the hospital to the Crosiers of the Red Star. \r\nCorrespondence surrounding Agnes illustrates that she was truly captivated by the Franciscan ideal. Clare's tender affection for Agnes, whom she had met only through letters and through the description of messengers, united Clare with the missionary zeal of the brothers. Having been caught in the currents of noble politicking and intrigue, Agnes knew the emptiness of the propertied life, and desired to embrace with all her heart a Rule that would soundly preserve Francis and Clare's ideal of living without property. Both she and Clare received their wish when Innocent IV approved Clare's Rule on August 9, 1253, just two days before Clare's death. Clare's Rule, the first ever to be approved that was written by a woman, solved for a time ecclesiastical interference concerning the practice of poverty that both Clare and Agnes had promised to follow. \r\nAgnes outlived Clare by thirty years. As Agnes grew older, the political situation in her beloved Bohemia became more and more precarious. Ecclesiastics repeatedly attempted to persuade Agnes to accept property and revenues in order to protect her from the destitution that falls to the poor during times of war and famine. Knowing well the consequences, Agnes and her sisters steadfastly rejected these privileges. \r\nAlthough Agnes repeatedly used her influence to try to insure peace and stability for her beloved Bohemia, her nephew King Otakar II's hunger for power and possessions, and his propensity to achieve these ends by means of despotic cruelty, eventually undermined political discretion. Despite warnings from his aunt, and despite a lack of solid allegiance from the Bohemian nobility, Otakar decided to make war against Rudolph of Hapsburg and died in battle on August 26, 1278. Rudolph entrusted Otto, the margrave of Brandenburg, with Bohemia. Otto, a grandnephew of Agnes, misused his power, destroying and plundering royal and ecclesiastical property. He kept the king's widow, Cunegunda, and her three children imprisoned in a castle in northern Bohemia. \r\nFamine, epidemics, and incessant warfare followed in Bohemia, and Agnes's convent became a refuge for the sick and hungry as well as a stronghold of Bohemian pride. There were floods that, along with bringing hardship and disease to an already stressed population, prohibited the mills from operating. Inflation soared. Meat, fish, cheese, eggs, and grain products were difficult to find.

Agnes's mother was a sister to Andrew II of Hungary, the father of Saint Elizabeth. Constance was the second wife of Otakar; the first, Adele, was the daughter of the margrave of Meissen. Otakar and Adele had four children. As time passed, Otakar grew tired of Adele preferring the younger Constance. He used the fact that Adele was a distant relative as grounds for dispensation, and convinced Bishop Daniel of Prague to annul the marriage. Adele appealed to Pope Innocent III, but died before the matter was settled. Constance and Otakar had nine children. Otakar's oldest living son from this second marriage, Wenceslas I, became his successor . \nAgnes's father was a master politician who secured for Bohemia its hereditary dynasty. Anxious to expand and protect his kingdom, Otakar betrothed his daughters diplomatically. At the age of three, Agnes was sent to Silesia with her older sister, Anna, who was to be engaged to Henry II, son of the duke of Silesia. \nAnna and Agnes were placed under the care of their aunt, Duchess (Saint) Hedwig of Silesia (1174-1243). Hedwig arranged that the young Agnes be cared for by the Cistercian nuns of Trebnitz. Anna stayed in Silesia and was married to Henry II in 1216. \nUpon her return to Prague, Agnes was sent to the Premonstratensian convent of Doxany in Bohemia. In 1143, this convent had been founded by Queen Gertrude, Agnes's grandmother, for the purpose of educating daughters of the aristocracy. Its nuns were daughters of the highest nobility, and the convent was known for its pedagogical excellence. It was here that Agnes learned to read. \nSometime during 1219-1220, Agnes was betrothed to Henry VII, son of the German emperor Frederick II.

"34","Paula, the elder","","Paula was born into a rich patrician family.  A Christian, she was married to a pagan, Toxotius, with whom she had five children.  After his death in 379 she lived an ascetic life and spent her wealth on charity, though she was able to host important visitors like Epiphanius of Salamis while he was in Rome.  She was educated in Latin and Greek, and learned Hebrew to study the Old Testament.  A disciple of Marcella and of Jerome, whom she followed to Jerusalem in 385 after he left Rome, she worked closely with him and inspired much of his writing, though she died before he finished some of it.  He says that he wrote to her and her daughter Eustochium every day,(1) but those letters were not collected, so even he does not know how many there were and they are not extant.  There are only three separate letters from Jerome to Paula in his collected letters, all written before they left Rome, but the prologues of many of his works of translation and exegesis which she had requested are addressed to her and they include important expositions of his scholarly positions on the bible and on different translations as well as defenses against his attackers.
Even in those books which are addressed to others, Jerome emphasizes Paula's role in his work.  He lists his commentaries on the twelve prophets in his third book on Amos addressed to his friend and Paula's son-in-law Pammachius (CCSL76, 300), and reminds him that he had done the first four prophets, not in the order in which they are found in the old testament but in the order in which Paula and her daughter Eustochium had requested them.  In the prologue to Joel, also addressed to Pammachius, Jerome remembers Paula's role, offering Pammachius ""what we promised your holy and venerable relative, Paula, take it as her pious heir"" (CCSL 76, 160).  And in the prologue to his commentary on Hosea, Jerome tells Pammachius that ""about twenty-two years ago at the request of Paula, your holy and venerable mother-in-law, or rather your mother — that name is of the flesh, this of the spirit — who always burned with love of monasteries and scriptures,"" he had asked Didymus to complete what Origen had left undone, commentaries on Hosea, but together Didymus and Origen had only covered a third of Hosea, so in this commentary too Jerome is completing work originally undertaken for Paula.  In the preface to his translation of Joshua, Jerome mentions that he completed the work ""after the death of holy Paula, whose life is an example of virtue"" for Eustochium whom he could not deny and at the urging of Pammachius (PL28 c.506).  The commentaries on Isaiah and Ezekiel, both completed for Eustochium, mention that he had promised her holy mother while she was alive to do them (CCSL73, 1 and CCSL 75, 3).
There had been rumors about Paula and Jerome when they were still in Rome, which Jerome denied in a letter he wrote to Asella, a virgin in Marcella's household, ep.45.  He admits to a fascination with Paula, the only woman who could ""tame my mind,"" whom he describes as mourning and fasting, squalid with dirt, almost blinded by tears (ep.45.3); when he began to revere her for her sanctity, envy attacked them.  Jerome describes the development of his relationship with Paula as coming out of their constant association in study, which brought familiarity, and that led to full confidence.  Paula followed Jerome to the East with her daughter Eustochium, leaving two younger children behind.  They visited the holy places together and then settled in Bethlehem in 386.  Paula established houses for herself and other religious women and for Jerome and his monks, spending her wealth to keep them all going, and she finally died there, early in 404.
Paula's children were Blesilla, Paulina who married Pammachius, Eustochium, Rufina, and Toxotius who married Laeta.  Several of them followed her into the religious life.  Only Paulina, wife of Jerome's friend and Marcella's cousin Pammachius, did not become religious, though her husband took up an ascetic life after she died.  
Jerome wrote to Pammachius after Paulina's early death, praising the women of the family joined by blood and virtue:  Eustochium, he said, harvests the flowers of virginity, Paula rubs the laborious threshing-floor of widowhood, Paulina preserves the chaste bed of matrimony (ep.66.2), and Pammachius joins them, making a “quadriga,” a team of four horses from one house.  Jerome connects each of them with a cardinal virtue, Pammachius with prudence, Paula with justice, the virgin with fortitude and the wife with temperance (66.3).  At the end of the letter, Jerome says they can not forget Blesilla, who preceded them to the lord, so he divides the family group of five into the two who have died, Paulina and Blesilla, and the three who will fly together to Christ, Paula, and Eustochium, with Pammachius between them (66.15).  It is clear that putting Pammachius in the company of such women is a compliment; indeed Jerome tells his old friend even if you did all I said, you would be surpassed by Paula and Eustochium, if not in deed then in sex (66.13).
After Paula's death, Jerome wrote to Eustochium about her, in a long (thirty-four chapter) letter, a ""little book"" (“libellum”) which is virtually a saint's life.  It begins with the rhetorical flourish, ""If all the members of my body were turned into tongues and all my joints sounded with human voice, I could say nothing worthy of the virtues of holy and venerable Paula,"" and ends with the poems on her tomb and the cave outside.  Jerome cites her biblical allusions and comments about life on earth (108.1), and the vision she had in Bethlehem (108.10), describes her illustrious genealogy to praise her scorn of it, her five children, her grief at the death of her husband, and her decision to leave her family and live among the hermits of the East.  He speaks of her enthusiastic travels through the Holy Land, building cells and monasteries for the religious and hostels for pilgrims along the travel routes; and she built one monastery for men, three communities for women, for which she established the order of living.(!2)  He praises her extraordinary charity to the poor to whom she gave all she had, borrowing money at interest to give more and dying in debt, and her rigorous asceticism.  She would not drink wine even when sick and pressed by the bishop to do so, at Jerome's suggestion, as she had guessed; indeed, she almost convinced the bishop to give up wine (108.21).  She stood up to Origenists as enemies of God and could not be tricked by them (108.23,25).  She was slow to speak, quick to listen, knew the scriptures by heart, loved the literal sense as the basis of truth and followed the mystical as the crown of the soul's edifice; she knew Hebrew which Jerome says he had struggled over from adolescence, while she could sing the psalms and speak it without a Latin accent (108.26).  With her daughter Eustochium (though this letter is addressed to her it is certainly meant for a larger audience) she read the Old and New Testaments with Jerome and compelled him to explain to them what he had not yet learned for himself, and when he hesitated among the teachings of illustrious men of the church, she pressed him with questions, forcing him to give an opinion.  Jerome sat with her for hours while she was sick, was with her when she died,(!3) and composed two verses for her tomb, the only surviving verses we have of his:
	Born from the Scipios, sprung from pauline parents,
	scion of the Gracchi, child of the famed Agamemnon.
	Here in this tomb lies Paula, foremost in fame;
	mother of Eustochium, first in the Senate of Rome, she was.
	She made herself a pauper following   Christ to rural Bethlehem.
 
	Do you see this tomb, hollowed from the rock? It is Paula's resting place as 					      she takes up her celestial kingdom.
	She left brother, family, her home in Rome, wealth and progeny for a cave in Bethlehem.
	Here was the manger and here the magi
	bore mystical gifts to Christ, both man and God.(!4)","(1) In a catalogue of his works, De viris illustribus, ch.135:  Epistolarum autem ad Paulam et Eustochium, quia quotidie scribuntur, incertus est numerus, PL23, c.759.

(!2) One for nobles, one for women of the middle-class, one for those of the lower-class; they worked and ate separately, but sang and prayed together, and all dressed alike.  She encouraged them to give no care to their bodies or clothes:  ""a clean body and dress bespeak a soiled soul"" (108.20).  All had to know the psalms, and learn something from the scriptures each day.  She allowed them no personal possessions, and was rigid in her requirements, but kind to them when they were sick, and stimulated them by her example (ep.108.20).

He admits to a fascination with Paula, the only woman who could ""tame my mind,"" whom he describes as mourning and fasting, squalid with dirt, almost blinded by tears (ep.45.3); when he began to revere her for her sanctity, envy attacked them.  Jerome describes the development of his relationship with Paula as coming out of their constant association in study, which brought familiarity, and that led to full confidence.  Paula followed Jerome to the East with her daughter Eustochium, leaving two younger children behind.  They visited the holy places together and then settled in Bethlehem in 386.  Paula established houses for herself and other religious women and for Jerome and his monks, spending her wealth to keep them all going, and she finally died there, early in 404.
Paula's children were Blesilla, Paulina who married Pammachius, Eustochium, Rufina, and Toxotius who married Laeta.  Several of them followed her into the religious life.  Only Paulina, wife of Jerome's friend and Marcella's cousin Pammachius, did not become religious, though her husband took up an ascetic life after she died.  
Jerome wrote to Pammachius after Paulina's early death, praising the women of the family joined by blood and virtue:  Eustochium, he said, harvests the flowers of virginity, Paula rubs the laborious threshing-floor of widowhood, Paulina preserves the chaste bed of matrimony (ep.66.2), and Pammachius joins them, making a “quadriga,” a team of four horses from one house.  Jerome connects each of them with a cardinal virtue, Pammachius with prudence, Paula with justice, the virgin with fortitude and the wife with temperance (66.3).  At the end of the letter, Jerome says they can not forget Blesilla, who preceded them to the lord, so he divides the family group of five into the two who have died, Paulina and Blesilla, and the three who will fly together to Christ, Paula, and Eustochium, with Pammachius between them (66.15).  It is clear that putting Pammachius in the company of such women is a compliment; indeed Jerome tells his old friend even if you did all I said, you would be surpassed by Paula and Eustochium, if not in deed then in sex (66.13).
After Paula's death, Jerome wrote to Eustochium about her, in a long (thirty-four chapter) letter, a ""little book"" (“libellum”) which is virtually a saint's life.  It begins with the rhetorical flourish, ""If all the members of my body were turned into tongues and all my joints sounded with human voice, I could say nothing worthy of the virtues of holy and venerable Paula,"" and ends with the poems on her tomb and the cave outside.  Jerome cites her biblical allusions and comments about life on earth (108.1), and the vision she had in Bethlehem (108.10), describes her illustrious genealogy to praise her scorn of it, her five children, her grief at the death of her husband, and her decision to leave her family and live among the hermits of the East.  He speaks of her enthusiastic travels through the Holy Land, building cells and monasteries for the religious and hostels for pilgrims along the travel routes; and she built one monastery for men, three communities for women, for which she established the order of living.(!2)  He praises her extraordinary charity to the poor to whom she gave all she had, borrowing money at interest to give more and dying in debt, and her rigorous asceticism.  She would not drink wine even when sick and pressed by the bishop to do so, at Jerome's suggestion, as she had guessed; indeed, she almost convinced the bishop to give up wine (108.21).  She stood up to Origenists as enemies of God and could not be tricked by them (108.23,25).  She was slow to speak, quick to listen, knew the scriptures by heart, loved the literal sense as the basis of truth and followed the mystical as the crown of the soul's edifice; she knew Hebrew which Jerome says he had struggled over from adolescence, while she could sing the psalms and speak it without a Latin accent (108.26).  With her daughter Eustochium (though this letter is addressed to her it is certainly meant for a larger audience) she read the Old and New Testaments with Jerome and compelled him to explain to them what he had not yet learned for himself, and when he hesitated among the teachings of illustrious men of the church, she pressed him with questions, forcing him to give an opinion.  Jerome sat with her for hours while she was sick, was with her when she died,(!3) and composed two verses for her tomb, the only surviving verses we have of his:
	Born from the Scipios, sprung from pauline parents,
	scion of the Gracchi, child of the famed Agamemnon.
	Here in this tomb lies Paula, foremost in fame;
	mother of Eustochium, first in the Senate of Rome, she was.
	She made herself a pauper following   Christ to rural Bethlehem.
 
	Do you see this tomb, hollowed from the rock? It is Paula's resting place as 					      she takes up her celestial kingdom.
	She left brother, family, her home in Rome, wealth and progeny for a cave in Bethlehem.
	Here was the manger and here the magi
	bore mystical gifts to Christ, both man and God.(!4) (!1) In a catalogue of his works, De viris illustribus, ch.135:  Epistolarum autem ad Paulam et Eustochium, quia quotidie scribuntur, incertus est numerus, PL23, c.759.

(!2) One for nobles, one for women of the middle-class, one for those of the lower-class; they worked and ate separately, but sang and prayed together, and all dressed alike.  She encouraged them to give no care to their bodies or clothes:  ""a clean body and dress bespeak a soiled soul"" (108.20).  All had to know the psalms, and learn something from the scriptures each day.  She allowed them no personal possessions, and was rigid in her requirements, but kind to them when they were sick, and stimulated them by her example (ep.108.20).

"89","Radegund of Thuringia","Queen of the Franks, nun of Poitiers","Radegund was the daughter of a king of Thuringia, Berthachar.  After the Franks conquered  Thuringia in 531, killing most of the royal family and capturing Radegund, the Frank king Clothar won her by lot from his brothers.    Clothar, whose mother Clothild was revered as a saint, had four other wives.  Before he married Radegund in 540, he sent the child to his villa of Athies in Picardy for several years. But when he had her brother murdered she fled the marriage.  
The bishop of Soissons tried to avoid consecrating her because he had been threatened by her husband’s men, but Radegund threatened him with divine vengeance if he let her soul escape the church, so he made her a deacon, an old position which did not require virginity or widowhood.  When Clothar finally accepted the fact that she would not return to the world, he underwrote what JoAnn McNamara describes as “the first large-scale female monastery that we know about among the Franks” (Sisters in Arms, 98). Radegund established Sainte-Croix of Poitiers in 550, adopting Caesarius’ Rule for Nuns, and appointing Agnes the first abbess; Radegunde remained there for over thirty years.  
Gregory of Tours suggests that by adopting Caesarius’ Rule, she meant to tie Sainte-Croix to the diocese of Arles rather than Poitiers, whose bishop Maroveus she had poor relations with.  Maroveus refused to install her relics, among them a piece of the True Cross, which she had sent for and collected at some expense from Constantinople.  Radegunde wrote to King Sigibert, who sent the bishop of Tours to install them, and Fortunatus wrote a major hymn for the occasion, “Vexilla regis prodeunt.”  Maroveus also refused to conduct her funeral, which was attended by Gregory of Tours.
Fortunatus exchanged poems frequently with Radegund and Agnes and after her death wrote a life of the saint.  Baudonivia, a nun of Poitiers wrote another life adding to what Fortunatus had said.*  Gregory of Tours also included many details of her life in his History of the Franks and cites some of the letters in her correspondence; he describes her miracles in his Book of Miracles.
Though we know from Fortunatus that he and Radegund exchanged gifts and poems, only his are extant.  But we do have three of her epistolary poems, one on the destruction of her land and people to her cousin Hamalafred, to whom she had been close as a child and whose absence she feels most strongly, one to her nephew Artachis, which begins with a lament for her fallen land and her dead father and uncles, and one praising the emperor Justinus and the empress Sophia who had sent her the relics of the cross. The poems have been attributed to Fortunatus but since we know she wrote poems and she inscribes her name in these, there seems no good reason to deny her authorship.

He left the court in 830.   Two of Imma’s letters survive, preserved among his, but otherwise all we know of her is the praise of Lupus of Ferrieres in a letter of consolation to Einhard after her death.  Lupus praises her “prudentia, gravitas, honestas.”  He describes her as one who “had indeed learned many things from her association with you, so that she far surpassed not only those of her own sex but even ordinary men in her remarkable wisdom, sobriety, and uprightness, qualities which contribute great dignity to human life, and although a mere woman in body, she had achieved in spirit the stature of man.”(1)  If Einhard himself wrote about her during her life, we do not have it.  But after she died,  on 13 December 835, he wrote to his friend Lupus that he was reminded of the loss of his “fidissima coniunx”  in “every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities.”(2) Smith assumes that when Einhard traveled without her, he left the administration of the church and the property in her hands (p.70).

Julia Smith notes that the first mention of Imma is in a diploma by means of which Louis the Pious granted two estates in eastern Francia, Michelstadt and Mulinheim ‘to our faithful man Einhard and his wife Imma’ on 11 January, 815 (p.57).  Smith suggests that Imma may have come from a local landowning family in the vicinity of these estates, that she might have been the widow or daughter of Count Drogo, the former holder of Mulinheim and they may have had a son, Vussin (Smith, 57-58).  They made a will in 819 transferring the estate at Michelstadt to the royal monastery of Lorsch but reserving the usufruct of it for their lives.  Bishop Gozbald of Wurzburg kept notes of the deaths of important people at the royal court and Imma is the only woman mentioned (Smith, 58).   Einhard and Imma were buried in the same tomb, close to the remains of the martyrs Marcellinus and Peter to whom they and their church were devoted (70).

Her sister, Richild, was married to Count Biwin, an Austrasian noble; their daughter, also Richild, became the second wife of Charles the Bald.  Lothar II of Lotharingia married Theutberga to gain the support of her family, particularly her brother Hugobert, but Hugobert did not provide the desired support and Theutberga did not bear a child.  Lothar tried to divorce her in order to legitimize the son he had had with his mistress Waldrada, but she did not acquiesce and she had the support of bishop Hincmar of Reims and the pope, Nicholas I. Lothar began divorce proceedings in 858, and  accused Theutberga of incest with Hugobert.  After the accusation, Hubert and Theutberga fled to Lothar’s uncle, Charles the Bald, who took them in and gave her refuge in a nunnery.

He imprisoned her until she asked to be removed from the marriage in order to enter a convent in 860, but she refused at first to make a public confession; eventually, perhaps under threat of torture, she did confess to “femoral incest” and the conception of a child whom she aborted.  The bishops of Lotharingia wrote to Hincmar of Reims to ask if a woman could conceive a child and remain a virgin, to which he answered that with witchcraft the female vulva could attract sperm without copulation, but he did not accept that her guilt had been established as prescribed in canon law; he did however say that a man’s lover (in this case Waldrada) could by sorcery prevent the man from impregnating a woman, so he recommended the exorcism of Lothar rather than divorce from Theutberga.  Lothar convinced a synod of his bishops to annul the marriage in 862 and he married Waldrada.  Another synod in 863 found his original liaison with Waldrada to have been a lawful marriage, which rendered his marriage to Theutberga invalid.   But Nicholas convoked a synod at the Lateran which annulled the proceedings of Lothar’s synods, deposed the bishops involved, and ordered Lothar to return to Theutberga.  Under pressure from his uncles, Lothar did so in 865.  Lothar continued to pressure her, however, to ask for a separation on the grounds of her barrenness, but the pope did not accept those grounds and furthermore told Lothar he could not remarry even if she entered a monastery; she would eventually retire to Avenay.

"111","Margaret of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders","Countess of Flanders","Margaret/Marguerite was the second daughter of Baldwin IX Count of Flanders and Hainaut, first Latin Emperor of Constantinople, and Marie de Champagne (daughter of Henry the Liberal of Champagne and Marie of France).  Marie died in 1204, Baldwin in 1205, as a captive in Bulgaria after a military defeat, leaving two daughters, Joan and her much younger sister Margaret, as his heirs.  The sisters were turned over to the custody of the French king, Philip II Augustus by their uncle Philip the Noble of Namur, who ruled as regent in Joan’s name.  When Joan died in December 1244, Margaret became the ruler of Flanders and Hainaut.
Margaret eloped with and married Burchard of Avesnes when she was very young, in 1212, without the permission of her sister, who fought to undo the marriage.  She enlisted the support of popes, Innocent III and Honorius III, both of whom excommunicated Bouchard to no effect.  The marriage produced two sons, John and Baldwin, but Margaret finally left him.  Margaret and Burchard were divorced in 1221, and in 1225 Margaret married William II of Dampierre who died in 1232; that marriage produced three sons and three daughters, whom Margaret favored over her Avesnes sons.  The two lines were rivals for the succession.  When Margaret went to do hommage to her cousin Louis IX(1) for Flanders and Hainaut, she brought her eldest Dampierre son, William, with her as her heir, but they were challenged by the Avesnes sons who asserted John’s claim as first born.  John and Baldwin had been declared illegitimate by Gregory IX in 1236, but recognized by the emperor Frederick II as legitimate heirs of both parents in 1242.  William insulted them before the court, calling them sons of an apostate priest.  The rivalry extended to the people of their regions, Hainaut supporting the Avesnes, Flanders the Dampierres.  With civil war threatening, an agreement was reached by arbitration of the king of France and the papal legate, Cardinal Eudes, giving the succession to Hainaut to the Avesnes and that of Flanders to the Dampierres.  Margaret had the Hainaut arms removed from her escutcheon, though she remained its ruler.
John, who was married to Alix/Adela, daughter of Floris/Florence of Holland, continued to press claims to Flemish islands, and made war on his mother with the support of his father-in-law, doing considerable damage.  His brother-in-law, William, elected King of the Romans in 1247(by forces opposed to Frederick II), demanded hommage for Flanders from Margaret who would not pay it, and William declared John of Avesnes count of Flanders.  In 1249, William of Dampierre, still recognized as count of Flanders by the French king, distinguished himself on crusade with Louis IX, but died in a tourney after his return home.  He was succeeded as heir to Flanders by his brother, Guy, married to Mathilda of Bethune.  Margaret, suspecting that the Avesnes were in some way responsible for John’s death, retaliated against Hainaut, replacing its administrators with Flemish, and imposing exorbitant taxes and tariffs.  There was a rebellion in which many Flemish were killed, and a war against the count of Holland and John of Avesnes.  The Flemish were defeated by Floris of Holland, Margaret’s remaining Dampierre sons, Guy and John, were captured and handed over to the anti-king William of Holland.  Margaret tried to ransom them but William would not negotiate, accusing her of breaking a treaty.  When Louis IX of France intervened on her behalf, William demanded a large ransom and polticial concessions.  Margaret refused and offered her cousin Louis the county of Hainaut which he refused; she then made it over for her lifetime to Louis’s brother, Charles of Anjou, who insisted on money to undertake an expedition.  In 1253, she paid him, taking out large loans to underwrite the enterprise.  Together she and Charles invaded Hainaut but were strongly resisted.  William opposed them, Charles eventually gave up any claim to Hainaut in 1256, and peace was made, leaving Hainaut to the Avesnes.  William was killed in an encounter with Frisians and John and Baldwin of Avesnes made overtures to their mother which she accepted in order to free her other sons.  Florent of Holland, son of William was married to Beatrice, daughter of Guy of Dampierre.  When Richard of Cornwall became king of the Romans, Margaret arranged to be invested with Flanders by him while her son Guy was negotiating secretly with the king of Castile in case he prevailed over Richard.  Guy bought the county of Namur from the eastern emperor, Baldwin II, in 1261, but Henry of Luxembourg had taken it over; Guy, whose first wife Mathilda had died, married Henry’s daughter Isabel.  
Margaret engaged in a trade war with England from 1270-75; she demanded that Henry III make good payments owed (a money fief), for her support during the revolt of Simon de Montfort.  Margaret allowed Henry’s queen Eleanor to stay At Damme and recruit mercenary soldiers from the low countries, but since she did not send soldiers at her expense to fight, Henry did not see reason to restore the fief.(2)  So she seized the possessions of English merchants in Flanders and Henry and Edward I seized those of Flemish merchants in England, who had been forewarned and had less of value to hand over.  Edward stopped exports of English wool to Flanders and townspeole who depended on the textile trade pressured the countess and her son Guy to agree to make restitution to English merchants; henceforth the Flemish no longer dominated the transport of goods between the continent and England.
 
Before Margaret died, she had her grandson, John of Avesnes, crowned as count of Hainaut, May 1279, and her son Guy of Dampierre proclaimed count of Flanders, September 1279.  She died five months later.
Like her sister, Margaret had favored commerce and industry, and encouraged communal independence; she organized a uniform monetary system, founded hospices for the poor and sick, and endowed many of the churches and abbeys in Flanders. In her will of 1273, three hundred religious houses and charitable establishments are named.  She also supported students from Flanders and Hainaut at the university of Paris.
","1 Margaret was first cousin of Louis VIII, her father Baldwin and Louis’s mother Isabel being siblings; Louis IX is thus her first cousin once-removed.

The elder Countess Bertha foiled a conspiracy against the emperor, Conrad II, in 1037, by intercepting the envoys of the conspirators who were trying to set up a meeting, and sending their letters which implicated the bishops of Vercelli, Piacenza, and Cremona, to the emperor so quickly and stealthily that he was able to seize them, pass judgment on them, and exile them without warning.(1). 
Besides the charters in which the elder Bertha joins her husband and her brother-in-law, Alrico, bishop of Asti, she is mentioned in document CCLVII (HPM, 1.441-43) as confirming with her husband the foundation of a college of canons of Sant’Aniano, and in CCCIV (HPM 1.519-21) in which emperor Conrad confirms gifts of land she and her husband made to the abbey of San Giusto di Susa.

"160","Adelicia","nun","Adelicia was a niece of the archdeacon of Poitiers, who tried to force her into the monastic life.  Peter of Blois wrote to him on her behalf.  Michael Markowski discusses that letter (PL 207, ep.54), in some detail, from which I quote:1 ""Peter criticized the archdeacon of Poitiers who was trying to force his niece into a nunnery.  Peter went right to the point:  'Adelicia, your niece, pleads and complains lamentably because you want to thrust her into a monastery and abandon her, unwilling and resisting, to the custody of a cloister.'   Peter wrote that Adelicia had been planning to marry and to raise a family, but now 'was compelled to forego motherhood' by her uncle.  Peter made plain that the central focus of the controversy was Adelicia's own intention.  We can see this in his phrases, 'unwilling and resisting woman ... compelled to forego motherhood.'  He wrote in glowing terms of her desire for marriage, 'the conjugal embrace,' and her desire for children, 'the fruit of posterity.'   He argued that Adelicia should only enter a cloister through her own free will, not through force. ...    Since Adelicia 'publicly' protested her entry into the cloistered life, it would be a 'perverse' wrong to force her.  Peter concluded: 'Desist, therefore, from the attempt' to force Adelicia into the cloistered life.""  But she did finally enter that life, and Peter wrote to her to say how much better a life it was.","""Treatment of Women in the Letter Collection of Peter of Blois,"" article in: Minorities in the Middle Ages, Ed.

"116","Anne of Kiev","Queen of France","Anne of Kiev (Anna Yaroslavna), sometimes called Agnes,  daughter of Yaroslav I of Kiev and Princess Ingegerd of Sweden; Yaroslav was grand-duke of Kiev and described in medieval histories as king of the Russians “rex Russorum”  (Hugh of Fleury, Aubry des Trois Fontaines, and Raoul Tortaire).  Jaroslav’s sister was married to Casimir, king of Poland.  Jaroslav and Ingegard had nine children, several of whom were married to royalty: Anastasia to Andrew I of Hungary, Elisabeth to Harold of Norway and later to Sven of Denmark, Isiaslav to the sister of Casimir of Poland, Vsevolod to a daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Vladimir to a niece of a former queen of France, Matilda of Stade.   Anne was married in 1051 to Henry I(1), king of France, whose first two wives(2) had died; she was consecrated queen at Reims when Liebert, bishop of Cambray was consecrated.  Anne brought no land to the marriage, but did bring connections and wealth, probably including a jacinth which Suger later mounted in the reliquary of St. Denis (Bauthier, 550; Hallu,168, citing Comptes de Suger).   Anne and Henry had three sons, Philip I(3), born 1052, Robert, born 1054, died young, and Hugh, born 1057, who became count of Vermandois by marriage.  Anne is associated in four of Henry’s acts, towards the end of his reign:  in 1058, a charter of concession to the monastery St. Maur-les-Fosses(4), “annuente mea conjuge Anna et prole Philippo, Roberto ac Hugone” (HGF, 11.600, XXXII); a donation of Villas to the monastery of Hasnon, with the signatures of Henrici regis, Philippi Regis pueri, A. Reginae (HGF 11.599, XXXI); 1059, assent to giving restored church to abbey of Coulombs, signed by Henry king, Anna queen his wife (Reginae uxoris ejus), and Philip, son of the king (HGF, 11.604, XXXV); and a concession to St. Martin des Champs, which the king, queen, and son Philip with his brothers confirm with their signatures, “Ego ipse Rex Henricus, et Regina pariter, et Philippus filius meus cum fratribus suis manufirmatam corroboravimus” (HGF, 11.605-6, XXXVI). 
But when Henry died in 1160, Anne participated in the government of her son, although Baldwin V of Flanders, married to Henry’s sister, Adele, was technically regent.  Baldwin described himself as “procurator et bajulus regni” but the bishop of Chartres speaks of Philip and Anne as his sovreigns (Prou, document VI, 1060).  Philip declares that as a child he took up the kingdom together with his mother (“ego, Philippus, filius ejus [Henrici] admodum parvulus, regnum unacum matre suscepissem,” Prou, XIII, 1061).  Anne signed various royal acts during Philip’s reign: see Prou, II, reconfirmation of a document of Henry’s confirming a donation to a monastery St. Pere de Chartres,“Philipus rex cum matre regina, hanc cartam firmavit”; III, confirming consent to the donation of a church to the abbey of St Pere, “Concessit autem hoc domnus meus rex Philipus, cum regina matre sua”; IV, gift to the abbey of St. Denis at the request of his paternal aunt, Adele, and the intervention of his mother, “per interventum matris mee A,” who signed it; V, renunciation of certain royal rights over a monastery of St. Lucien de Beauvais, “per interventum matris nostrae,” with her signature; VI, confirmation of a charter to abbot of Marmoutier to build a church, with the advice and will also of our most pious royal lords, “dominorum nostrorum piisimorum regum, Philippi scilicet et matris ejus, Agnetis”;  X, donation to St. Nicaise of Reims, with the counsel of our beloved mother “consilioque dilectissime matris nostre Anne”; XI, grants exemption to basilica of St. Adrieu in the presence of the queen “Interfuerunt autem etiam huic adstipulationi Agnes regina, …”; XVI, concession to abbey of St. Crepin, which is signed apparently by Anne’s hand in Cyrillic, Anna queen; XVIII, confirming a gift to the abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, signed Anna regina; XIX, confirmation of his father’s gift to St. Martin-des-Champs, with the good-will of his mother and count Baldwin, “favente matre atque comite Balduino”; XXXII, confirmation of renunciation of certain customs, signed Anna regina; according certain freedoms extended to other royal churches to a church restored by his mother, at her request, “mater mea, nomine Anna, divina inspirante”; LXXV, confirms the charter founding the monastery of Pontlevoy, signed Anne, matris Philippi regis.  Documents II-VI are dated 1060, X, XI, 1061, XVI, 1063; XVIII, XIX,1065, XXXII, 1067, XLIII, 1069, LXXV, 1075.  When Anne signs, it is either the first signature listed, or the first following the king’s (in XXXII, several bishops precede the signatures of the king and the queen).  There is also a confirmation by Henry of a donation to St. Peter of Chartres, dated 1059, which Philip and his mother signed in 1062, after Henry’s death, “Post mortem autem Henrici Regis, secundo anno regni sui Philippus Rex cum Regina matre sua … manu propria firmavit” (HGF, 11.602-4, XXXIV).  Hallu lists 23 acts of Philip's which mention Anne or carry her signature, four of them probably after her death, 185ff.
In 1061, Anne remarried, a powerful ally of the king, Raoul, count of Crepy and Valois, the Vexin, Amiens, Bar-sur-Aube, Vitry, Peronne, and Montdidier, who repudiated his wife, accusing her of adultery, to marry Anne.  But the wife, Eleanor of Champagne, appealed to the pope; Alexander II responded to her complaint, asking the archbishop of Reims to investigate, try to save the marriage or take appropriate steps.  Raoul refused to take her back and was excommunicated.  Nonetheless, he remains an important royal ally, signing some of Philip’s acts.  Raoul died in 1074 and Anne returned to Philip’s court.  There is one document of Raoul’s which Anne signed along with Raoul’s son, mentioned in HGF 11.433, dated 1069, a concession to a castle.(5)
","1 Henry was a son of Robert the Pious and Constance of Arles who preferred her younger son Robert to Henry to succeed his father, but primogeniture prevailed.  See Jean Dunbabin, “What’s in a Name?  Philip, King of France,” Speculum 68 (1993), 949-68 and Chronica Regum Francorum, HGF 11.393.
2 Robert-Henri Bauthier notes that Henry was betrothed first to a Matilda, daughter of Conrad II of Burgundy and Gisela, who died before the marriage was consumated, then to another Matilda, daughter of Liudolf of Stade, granddaughter of the same Gisela, and niece of Henry III (Anne de Kiev reine de France et la politique royale au Xe siècle, revue des Etudes Slaves, Vol. 57, 1985, 543-45).
3 Anne is said to have introduced the Greek name Philip into the French royal family.  Though, as Dunbabin notes, there is no recorded Philip in the Jaroslav family, the choice was probably meant to please her, as the name of an apostle important in the Greek tradition.

Peter also refers to her in a letter he wrote to retired empress Agnes, in which he says: “And no one could ever persuade me to return to the house from which I had set forth, a swift traveller, except once, by I know not what destiny, I crossed on a stormy night that gate on a public road. The second time I was compelled to visit my oldest sister of holy life who had brought me up in the place of a mother and then lay very sick” (ep.149). This letter suggests both that his early life was not very happy and that Rodelinda was a rare good memory from that period.

There were no sons of the marriage, though there may have been daughters. Hermesinde is mentioned in letters from Peter Damian to her sister-in-law (epp.104, 124):  “The empress alone with her sister-in-law Hermesinde, equally enflamed by the fervor of the holy Spirit, as Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the tomb not to anoint Christ's body, but to wash his feet with their tears, not to seek the living among the dead, but to adore the traces of the resurrected” (ep.104).   Hermesinde came to Rome with Agnes but apparently did not remain in the same house, since Peter mentions a visit she made with him to Agnes:  “I think, venerable lady, that since we — lord Rainald, bishop of the see of Como and the holy woman Hermesinde, widow of your brother [William Aigret V/VII], and I your servant — came back, your mind has fluctuated and, as if destitute of all solace deplores that it is left alone” (ep.124).","","11th century","","11th century",""

Peter Damian wrote to her to persuade her to correct the social injustices practiced by her husband’s family.  The family is mentioned, unfavorably, in another letter of Peter Damian’s. ep.66 to an Italian countess, Blanche.  Sophia, an aunt of Guilla’s husband, as sister of Uguccio, margrave of Tuscany, Guilla’s father-in-law, and daughter of the Rainerio who had been made duke of Spoleto and margrave of Camerino by Henry II, is cited as an example of selfish arrogance:  “Behold while we write these things, Sophia returns to our memory, namely of two marquises, sister of Uguccio, daughter of Rainerio; she, about six years before this, while still healthy and sound, asked the abbot of the monastery of the martyr St. Christopher, that she might build a tomb for herself, and with him resisting, she rather stubbornly carried out this folly. Upon entering, as soon as she saw the tomb constructed within the monks’ cloister, by what judgment I don’t know she fell ill, and shortly after miscarried and passed away. Indeed although its mound was gypsum and fortified on all sides by the skillful efforts of the masons, it breathed forth such a great flood of stench continuously through the cycle of the year on every side that it could scarcely be endured, nor did it allow the brothers to rest in the whole midst of the cloister itself. And although many tombs remained all around, they perceived that those same (tombs) and the expenses were much smaller; nothing except this alone brought disgust to the nostrils, so that by illustration it was more plainly noted that the more tenderly and gently human flesh is nourished, the worse it transforms into rottenness and nausea.
Peter also wrote a letter to Guilla’s husband, Rainerio II,  ep.151, in 1067, urging him to do the penance Peter had imposed on him for sins the marquis had confessed, to him.  Rainier did not want to carry out the penance, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.  Though the husband’s sins are not specified in Peter’s letter to him, they are identified in the letter to Guilla.

Their children were:  Matthias, who succeeded his father and married a Hohenstaufen, Judith/Bertha, daughter of Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, sister of Frederick Barbarossa; Robert, lord of Floranges; Agatha who married Renaud III, Count of Burgundy (their daughter Beatrice was the second wife of the emperor Frederick Barbarossa and mother of emperor Henry VI and Philip of Swabia and she inherited Burgundy from her father);  Hedwige, who married Frederick III, Count of Toul; Bertha, who married Margrave Hermann III of Baden; and Mathilde, who married Gottfried I, Count of Sponheim; and Baldwin.

Sancho was a descendant of Garcia Ramirez el Restaurador (the Cid).  Berengaria was closely related to royalty in France and England as well as Spain.  A brother, Sancho el Fuerte, succeeded his father; a sister, Blanche, married Thibaut of Champagne (grandson of Eleanor of Acquitaine and Louis VII), whose son succeeded Sancho VII as king of Navarre.  Berengaria was a witness at Blanche's marriage, which she may have been participated in arranging, and Blanche took Berengaria in when she was widowed and unable to claim her dower and later when her city was under interdict.1
One aunt, sister of Berengaria's father, married William the Bad of Sicily and their son William the Good married Joan (Joanna), daughter of Eleanor of Acquitaine and Henry II, and eventual sister-in-law of Berengaria.  Another paternal aunt married Sancho of Castile; their son Alfonso VIII married Eleanor of England, a sister-in-law of Berengaria, and their daughter Blanche married Louis VIII of France, son of Philip Augustus, who made it possible for Berengaria to live in and rule Le Mans.  Queen Blanche and her son treated Berengaria as a close relation and helped her to buy the land she needed to found her monastery.
Berengaria married Richard Lionheart, king of England in 1191.  She was brought from Navarre to Sicily by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Acquitaine; from there Eleanor's daughter and Berengaria's future sister-in-law, Joan, the widowed queen of Sicily, accompanied her to meet Richard.  They were shipwrecked on Cyprus, where they could not land for fear of being taken hostage by its ruler Isaac Comnenus; Richard came to the rescue with many crusading allies and took the island.  Richard and Berengaria were married at Limassol on Cyprus and Berengaria was crowned queen of England.  Berengaria and Joan accompanied Richard to Syria, but when they returned, Richard went by land and was captured, Berengaria and Joan by sea, stopping in Rome as guests of the pope for six months.
Berengaria never went to England, and bore no children.  When Richard died in 1199, therefore, she had no role.  She entered into a long struggle just to recover her dower lands which were in France; she was also supposed to receive Eleanor's lands in England, Normandy and Poitou after her death.  Despite various agreements and pressure from the papacy, John never paid his sister-in-law what was owed her.   She fought on various levels:  there are records of her claims to a particular castle, see RHP III, #61, October 18, 1216, in which pope Honorius tells an archbishop, dean, and archdeacon of Tours to conclude the case committed to them by Innocent III over possession of the castle of Segreio which Berengaria claimed as her dower right against William of Verchia/Wirchia/Guerchia who had despoiled her of it.   In July 1217, Honorius ordered them to compel William to restore the castle to Berengaria, RHP III, #678.  When John lost Normandy, Berengaria petitioned the victorious Philip Augustus and he settled the county of Maine on her in return for her dower properties in Normandy which he now controlled.  She lived and ruled in Maine, in the city of Le Mans, from 1204 until she died in 1230.
Berengaria founded the abbey of l'Espau, and was directly involved in ruling Le Mans.  She engaged in various struggles with the local bishop over corrupt practices in his church and jurisdictional issues.  Her authority over the city was recognized by the French crown in matters of extending city boundaries or enlarging cathedral precincts (Trindade, 161).  She arbitrated disputes and appointed functionaries.  But when she levied certain taxes and attempted to collect certain revenues, she encountered opposition from the cathedral chapter and the bishop who imposed interdicts.  On one occasion, described in a letter from Honorius III to the abbot of St. Genevieve and two Paris deans, when Berengaria and a ""large multitude of people"" had come to the church for Palm Sunday services, the bishop and the chapter refused them entry and shut the doors in their face ""to the confusion, injustice/injury, and scandal of many,""  RHP III #4237.

Erard, of a prominent Champagne family, whose cousin Jean of Brienne, was king of Jerusalem, married Philippa in in 1213 inorder to claim Champagne as her inheritance (Evergates, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, 83).  But when her father Henry II went on crusade in 1190, he left Champagne to his younger brother, Thibaut III.  Henry died in 1197, Thibaut in 1201, and Thibaut’s widow, Blanche of Navarre, did everything  to ensure that Champagne would go to her son, Thibaut IV, born after his father’s death.  The arguments against Philippa’s claims were based on the assertions that her parents’ marriage was invalid because Isabella’s first husband was still alive, so their children were illegitimate, and that Erard and Philippa were related within the prohibited degrees.  Honorius III refers to Philippa as “the illegitimate daughter of Henry, formerly count of Champagne” (illegitima filia Henrici quondam comitis Campaniae) in a bull repeating his excommunication of the couple, Layettes, 1.458, #1276, dated February, 1218.

Lewis, ""The Guillems of Montpellier: A Sociological Appraisal"", Viator, 2 (1971): 161.)  She apparently married Bernard Ato V before the end of 1146, when her father, leaving on crusade, made a will that included an order to his son and successor to pay the rest of her dowry.  He had in an earlier will named her as his heir after his three sons and their legal issue:  “If these three sons of mine, William the elder and William the younger and Bernard die without heirs from legal wives or their heirs die without heirs from legal marriage, I order that all their inheritance revert to my daughter Guillelma or her legal heir.  In the same manner if my daughter Guillelma should die without heir from legal husband or her heirs die without heir from legal marriage, the whole abovewritten fief should revert to my daughter Ermengarde or to her legal heir” (Devic and Vaissette, 5.891:  si isti tres filii mei Guillelmus major & Guillelmus minor & Bernardus moriant sine haeredibus de legalibus uxoribus vel haeredes eorum moriant sine haeredibus de legali conjugio, tota eorum haereditas jubeo ut ad Guillelmam filiam meam revertat vel ad haeredem ejus legalem.  Eodem modo si Guillelma filia mea moriat sine haerede de legali marito vel haeres ejus moriat sine haerede de legali conjugio, totus honor praescriptus revertat ad Ermengardem filiam meam vel ad haeredem ejus legalem).  Some years later in 1172, her brother, Guillaume VII, mentions her and her son, Bernard Ato VI, in his will, putting them in the succession after his brother and his daughters (see Layettes du Tresor des Chartes, 1.101a, #237).  Bernard Ato V was the third son of Bernard Ato IV, viscount of Albi, Béziers, Agde and Nîmes, who inherited Nimes and later the title of Agde.  He died c.1159, leaving Guillelma pregnant with Bernard Ato VI, for whom she was regent until his majority. There were problems but they were resolved (see Devic and Vaisette, 3.839-40):  an oath taken in June 1163 by knights of Arenes, the principal town of Nimes, promised peace with Raymond and no war with their viscount before he reached 14; Pons de Vezenobre revolted with a number of other knights against the young Bernard and his mother, but they were quickly brought round; a dispute between knights and bourgeois of Nimes ended with an accord in 1166; Eleazar de Sauve and his brother Rostaing renewed their oaths of fidelity c.1168 for castle of Bernis.  Guillelma participated in a number of charters with her husband before he died, after which she issued charters for herself and her son until his majority, then in 1175 he issued one “with the advice and consent of his mother” (Layettes, 1.109, #262).   Guillelma affirmed acts of her husband in 1177:   “Et ego Guillelma Nemausensis vicecomitissa, mater predicti B. Atonis, hec omnia predicta laudo & concedo” (Devic &Vaisette, 8.326-8).

Peter of R","","early 12th century","","late 12th century","Guillelma of Montpellier Viscountess of Nimes Guillelma is the eldest daughter of Guillaume VI of Montpellier and Sybilla, a Catalan noblewoman (A.R. Lewis, ""The Guillems of Montpellier: A Sociological Appraisal"", Viator, 2 (1971): 161.)  She apparently married Bernard Ato V before the end of 1146, when her father, leaving on crusade, made a will that included an order to his son and successor to pay the rest of her dowry.  He had in an earlier will named her as his heir after his three sons and their legal issue:  “If these three sons of mine, William the elder and William the younger and Bernard die without heirs from legal wives or their heirs die without heirs from legal marriage, I order that all their inheritance revert to my daughter Guillelma or her legal heir.  In the same manner if my daughter Guillelma should die without heir from legal husband or her heirs die without heir from legal marriage, the whole abovewritten fief should revert to my daughter Ermengarde or to her legal heir” (Devic and Vaissette, 5.891:  si isti tres filii mei Guillelmus major & Guillelmus minor & Bernardus moriant sine haeredibus de legalibus uxoribus vel haeredes eorum moriant sine haeredibus de legali conjugio, tota eorum haereditas jubeo ut ad Guillelmam filiam meam revertat vel ad haeredem ejus legalem.  Eodem modo si Guillelma filia mea moriat sine haerede de legali marito vel haeres ejus moriat sine haerede de legali conjugio, totus honor praescriptus revertat ad Ermengardem filiam meam vel ad haeredem ejus legalem).  Some years later in 1172, her brother, Guillaume VII, mentions her and her son, Bernard Ato VI, in his will, putting them in the succession after his brother and his daughters (see Layettes du Tresor des Chartes, 1.101a, #237).  Bernard Ato V was the third son of Bernard Ato IV, viscount of Albi, Béziers, Agde and Nîmes, who inherited Nimes and later the title of Agde.  He died c.1159, leaving Guillelma pregnant with Bernard Ato VI, for whom she was regent until his majority. There were problems but they were resolved (see Devic and Vaisette, 3.839-40):  an oath taken in June 1163 by knights of Arenes, the principal town of Nimes, promised peace with Raymond and no war with their viscount before he reached 14; Pons de Vezenobre revolted with a number of other knights against the young Bernard and his mother, but they were quickly brought round; a dispute between knights and bourgeois of Nimes ended with an accord in 1166; Eleazar de Sauve and his brother Rostaing renewed their oaths of fidelity c.1168 for castle of Bernis.  Guillelma participated in a number of charters with her husband before he died, after which she issued charters for herself and her son until his majority, then in 1175 he issued one “with the advice and consent of his mother” (Layettes, 1.109, #262).   Guillelma affirmed acts of her husband in 1177:   “Et ego Guillelma Nemausensis vicecomitissa, mater predicti B. Atonis, hec omnia predicta laudo & concedo” (Devic &Vaisette, 8.326-8).  Most of the available legal documents which Guillelma issued or in which she participated, are chirographs (records of  settlements which may or may not have been in dispute), published by Teulet in the Layettes du Tresor des Chartes. and translated below.  They are in Latin but draw on local Provencal/Occitan terms.

"171","Rangard of La Marche","Countess of Carcassonne","Rangard of La Marche was married to Peter Raymond of Carcassonne.  She is identified as the daughter of Amelia in some charters.  Her sisterAlmodis was married three times, first to Hugh of Lusignan, second to count Pons of Toulouse, third to count Ramon Berenguer of Barcelona.   Rangard and Peter Raymond has four children:  Ermengard, who married Raymond Bernard of Albi and Nimes, Roger, who died in 1067, Adalais who married the count of Cerdagne, and Garsendis.  After Peter Raymond died in 1060, Rangard ruled his counties with and for her son Roger.  Rangard was associated with her husband from 1054 on; after his death she received an oath of fidelity from his cousin Raymond, affirming her control of Carcassonne, Beziers, Agde and towns along the Herault river.   She and her son Roger received two castles and an oath of fidelity, Prouille and Mirepoix.  The marriage contract Rangard made with William Raymond of Cerdagne for marriage with her daughter Adalaide includes her promise to put him in control of castles within the Razes (and only the Raxzes), to have castellans swear oaths of fidelity to him.1  Rangard was looking for the support of Narbonne-Cerdagne by this marriage.   William Raymond was to share control of Razes with her, and to inherit it jointly with his wife after Rangard’s death, but he gave a different version later when he handed over his rights to the count and countess of Barcelona, along with his wife, whom he apparently abandoned.   When Roger died in 1067, various relations had claims to the succession:  his mother, Rangard, his sisters Adalaide (soon to marry the count of Cerdagne), Ermengard, wife of Raimond-Bernard (a Trencavel), viscount of Albi and Nimes, as well as first cousins and more distant relatives .  Rangard’s attempt  to hold on to power through the alliance with Cerdagne failed when her daughter Ermengard and Ermengard’s husband, the viscount of Albi and Nimes, joined with Rangard’s sister, Almodis, the countess of Barcelona, and her husband to take over the Carcassonne lands.   The two sisters and their husbands arranged a transfer of their brother’s and father’s lands, Adelaide and her husband selling the rights he claimed to have in Carcassonne to Ermengard and her husband, though as Cheyette points out, neither possessed the rights  they transferred:  “the upper aristocracy of this age and place were really quite free with gifts and sales of rights and properties over which they had no control” (“The `Sale’, 845).   In April 1070, Rangard accepted the transfer of power, giving up all her rights and claims in return for 400 ounces of gold; in August the abandoned Adalaide did the same with no recompense. \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ","1.

"5","Ermengard of Narbonne, viscountess of Narbonne","viscountess of Narbonne","Ermengard was the daughter of Aymeri II, viscount of Narbaronne, and an Ermengard about whose family nothing is known.(1) Ermengard succeeded her father in 1134, since her two older brothers had died, but she was a child and did not actually rule until 1143.  Narbonne, which was strategic in the wars between the lords of Toulouse and Barcelona, was seized by Alphonse Jordan, Count of Toulouse, in 1139 and he forced her to marry him in 1142, but that led to fighting in the region, and both Narbonne and Ermengard were ""liberated.""(2) She was married to Bernard d'Anduze, a viscount of Nîmes, in 1145.  Bernard was a widower with several children who, according to Caille, 10, offended no one, and was not active in Narbonne, which Ermengard ruled in her own right from 1143 to at least 1192.  Ermengard took military and diplomatic action with no mention of Bernard between 1148 and 1151; he died c.1157. His brother who had been archbishop of Narbonne died 1155-56 and was replaced by her uncle Berenger, abbot of Lagrasse.  Ermengard was known for her legal and diplomatic skills, and was called on to arbitrate disputes between lords and princes.  She obliged lords within the sway of Narbonne to submit to her power, she balanced vicecomital and archiepiscopal lordships, summoned the most active and educated townsmen to her council, who managed it with the knights for the common profit of all (Caille, 16-17). When Raymond Trencavel was captured by Raymond V of Toulouse, he asked the count of Barcelona to be the guardian of his wife and children, but left his son and his men in Ermengard’s service:  Et Hermengardae de Narbona meae consanguineae relinquo Robertum meum filium & meos homines in Dei garda & in sua & ad suum servicium (“And to Ermengard of Narbonne, my relative, I leave Robert my son and my men in God’s and her protection and to her service”).(3)  Pope Alexander III wrote to the French king to say Ermengard had rendered important services to him when he was in Montpellier in 1162 (Devic and Vaissette, 3.822-23).  Commercial treaties were signed with Genoa, Pisa, and Tortosa (4).  She made agreements on shared mines, took control of main arteries of communication, and had a new road built going toward Roussillon.  She was involved in a number of alliances against the count of Toulouse and led her own troops at the siege of Tortosa, 1148, the siege of Les Baux, 1162-63, in the alliance against Raymond V in 1157; in 1159, she was part of a coalition against Toulouse with Henry II of England, Raymond Berengar IV of Aragon, the Trencavel, Guillaume VII of Montpellier and others; in 1182 she was allied with Alfonse II of Aragon to support Henry II against his rebelling sons; in 1183, she was at the siege of Puy-Saint-Front outside Perigueux, w Alfonse, Henry II and three of his sons.  Caille sees an echo of Ermengard’s military role in the literary Ermengard, wife of Aymeri, who despite her white hair is the first to offer to come to the aid of her son, Guillaume, in  battle in Aliscans. Having no children of her own, Ermengard’s heirs were the sons of her sister Ermessend and Manrique de Lara, a Castilian noble.  She associated her sister’s sons with her in the rule of Narbonne, first Aymeri from 1167, and when he died in 1177, Pedro.  But by 1194 Pedro was acting alone; he took over the city, and presumably forced her into exile.  Her will in which she mentions the wrongs he has done her, is dated April 30, 1196 and she died in 1196 or 1197.  Ermengard was apparently a patron of poets. Narbonne is mentioned positively by a number of poets during her rule: Raimon de Miraval alludes to her generosity.(5) Bernard de Ventadorn praises her actions: ""Carry my poem to my lord/lady of Narbonne, for all her deeds are whole/true"" (Nichols, 23.57-59: Lo vers mi porta, Corona/ lai a midons a Narbona,/ que tuih sei faih son enter). Cf. Azalais de Porcairagues (a woman): ""carry my song to Narbonne, to her whom joy and youth guide"" (Bruckner, 11.50-52: ves Narbona portas lai/ ma chanson a la fenida/ lei cui iois e iovenz guida, cf. Rieger 27).(6) Guiraut de Bornelh raises a question about love and hope and then says ""ask my lord/lady of Narbonne about it"" (Kolsen 26.98-99: er o demandatz/ midons de narbona).(7) This tantalizing remark may lend weight to the notion that she participated in or judged love debates, as Andreas Capellanus implies. He names her as an arbiter of love matters (De amore, book 2, ch7, sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 15) and has her give judgments, one in philosophical language, two favoring the woman's choice, two against love in marriage, and one defending a man's right to enjoy love despite deformities derived from battle, appropriate perhaps to a ruler who had been involved in warfare. Cheyette has discovered 64 archival documents that bear her name in French and Spanish archives (Ermengard of  Narbonne, 5).  Vaissette published a few which are translated here and two summaries:  from  Actes relatifs a l’eglise de Elne, CCXXX c.1536  1155, 14 November:  Arnold, bishop of Elne and his feudataire, (feudatory) Gerard of Avalri, agree on the subject of regales and justices of the city of Elne, through the intervention of the archbishop of Tarragon, the bishop of Ausone, and Ermengard, viscountss of Narbonne, and several other lords.

"21","Adela, countess of Blois, Chartres, and Meaux","Countess of Blois, Chartes, and Meaux","Adela was the daughter of William the Conqueror, sister of Henry I of England, wife of and regent for Stephen of Blois, and mother of Stephen, king of England.  Born to the purple, after her father became king of England, Adela could claim royal blood on both sides — her mother Matilda of Flanders was descended from Robert the Pious through her mother and king Alfred through her father — which gave Adela particular prestige.  She was co-ruler with her husband until he went on [the first] crusade in 1096, a venture she underwrote with her personal wealth; then she ruled for him for three years.  When he came back without fulfilling his vow, indeed with the shame of a cowardly retreat, Adela urged him to return to the Holy Land, where he died in 1102.(1)  She continued to rule for her sons, and even for her childless brother-in-law Hugh, count of Troyes, while he was on crusade, keeping the family holdings intact, and she participated in meetings between her brother and her sons as late as 1118. She was involved in the secular and religious politics of England and northern France until her retirement.  Kimberly LoPrete calls Adela “one of the most prestigious, influential, and effective power brokers in the turbulent secular and ecclesiastical politics of the late-eleventh and early-twelfth centuries.”(2)\r\nAdela had five sons, William, count of Chartres, Thibaud IV count of Blois (II of Champagne), Odo, Stephen (king of England), and Henry (abbot of Glastonbury, bishop of Winchester, papal legate in England), and at least one daughter, Matilda (married Richard of Chester, died on the White Ship), and perhaps Agnes.(3)  Thibaud’s sons Henry of Champagne and Thibaud V of Blois, married Marie and Alice, daughters of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII, his daughter Adela married Louis VII and was the mother of Philip Augustus, so Adela was mother of the king of England and greatgrandmother of the king of France.  In 1120, Adela retired to Marcigny, where she died in 1137.\r\nIvo, bishop of Chartres, wrote frequently to Adela about problems in their common jurisdiction.  He often criticized her actions and warned against her tendency to anger, but he did his best to maintain a working relationship.(4)  Nine letters from him are extant.  Ivo also mentions a letter from Adela to him which we do not have about the scandalous life of the nuns at Faremoutiers, c.1098 (see Ivo to Walter II, bishop of Meaux, ep.70).  Adela issued various charters, grants of land, of jurisdiction, rights to and freedom from customs, vicarial rights, both during her regency and after she had retired to Marcigny.

She was, as Pauline Stafford points out, daughter, sister, and aunt of three consecutive kings of Burgundy, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, and grandmother of three consecutive kings of France, wife, mother, and grandmother of three Ottonian emperors.(1)  She was also queen of Italy in her first marriage to Lothar II (947-50); she ruled his land when he died without a son in 950 and brought it to her marriage to Otto (951).(2)  She was the first Ottonian empress — Otto I became emperor in 962 after their marriage — and participated in the government with him.  When Otto died in 973 she was regent for her son, Otto II, and after his death in 983 for her grandson, Otto III, sharing the latter position with her daughter-in-law Theophanu, and eventually ceding it to her, but returning after Theophanu's death in 991.\r\nThe dramatic story of Adelaide's passage from Lombardy to Germany is told by the nun Hrotsvit in Gesta Ottonis, written for the emperor's family during the lifetime of the empress, so while it may be somewhat romaticized it is presumably not entirely fiction.

After the death of Emma's husband Lothar, who had at times been an enemy of the Ottonians, she served briefly as regent for her son.

"105","Adelaide of Turin and Susa","Countess of Turin and Savoy","Adelaide,  heiress of the Ardoinid marquesses of Turin, was the daughter of  Ulric-Manfred, marques of Turin, and Bertha, daughter of the Otbertine marques Otbert II.  Bertha was ruling in the mark after her husband’s death, since she was able to capture envoys who wished to cross Alps to Champagne and met in Piedmont, in 1037 (1).   Ulric-Manfred and Bertha had three known daughters, Adelaide, Irmingarde or Immula, and Bertha.  If they had a son, he predeceased his father, so Adelaide was heir to the mark.  Immula married a Franconian noble, Otto of Schweinfurt, later duke of Swabia, and after his death, Ekbert marquess of Meissen; Bertha married Teto, an Aleramid marquess.  \r\nAdelaide was married three times, carrying the mark of Turin with her to her husbands, but retaining control of it after their deaths.  She was married by 1036 first to Herman, duke of Swabia, related by marriage to the emperor Conrad II, presumably to keep the mark of Turin allied to the crown and to counterbalance the power of the mark of Tuscany.  Herman died in 1038.  Adelaide’s second husband was Henry, marquess of Montferrat, who died c.1044.   The third, c. 1045, was Oddo I,  Count of Savoy.  That marriage united a large territory on both sides of the Alps with important Alpine passes. The union of Savoy and Turin made it one of the most powerful houses of the empire.(2)  After Oddo’s death (by May, 1060), Adelaide ruled from 1060 to 1091, with her sons and alone.  This was a period of turmoil for the empire, weak central government, a period of church-reform, a push for clerical celibacy, and revolts in the cities.   Adelaide furthered ecclesiastical reform cautiously, but kept a middle path between the papacy and the empire, maintaining the mark of Turin in the older traditions of government.  Like Matilda of Tuscany, in the words of Previte-Orton, “she was the last of a race of marchional dynasts” (223).  She refused to accept the autonomy of Asti, where there was a revolt at Asti against a bishop named by the emperor, presumably nominated by Adelaide, c.1061; in 1070 Adelaide captured and burnt the city with much slaughter and restored the bishop (Previte-Orton, 228).  In March, 1091, again, she captured and almost wholly burnt Asti, nine months before her death in December.\r\n\r\nAdelaide and Oddo had five children, Peter I, Count of Savoy (died 1078), Amadeus II, Count of Savoy (died 1080), Otto, bishop of Asti, Bertha of Savoy, and Adelaide.  Peter married a neice of the dowager empress, Agnes of Aquitaine; Adelaide married Henry IV’s widowed brother-in-law, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, duke of Swabia, and Bertha married the emperor Henry IV in 1066.  That marriage began badly and Henry tried to repudiate her, but was firmly dissuaded by Peter Damian as papal legate and the German princes who worried about incurring the anger of her family.  Thereafter the marriage apparently worked well, until she died in 1088.  German opponents of the emperor elected Rudolf of Swabia (the younger Adelaide’s husband) as anti-king, in March 1077, and the problem was only resolved when he died in 1080.\r\n\r\nIn a battle between Henry IV and pope Gregory VII over the archbishopric of Milan and other bishops whom Henry had invested according to imperial custom which Gregory was fighting, the pope excommunicated him, and Henry got his bishops to declare the pope deposed, at Worms in January 1076.  But when German princes rebelled and Henry had to get to Lombardy, where he had support, he appealed to his mother-in-law.  He came with his wife and child and met with Adelaide and her son Amadeus at Coise.  She demanded five bishoprics but instead apparently got a rich piece of Burgundy (Previte-Orton, 237, drawing on the Annals of Lambert of Hersfeld).  Then she arranged for him and his party to make the difficult winter passage at Mount Cenis so he could get to Pavia, where he was joined by Lombard vassals, marquesses and bishops.  Gregory went to Canossa and Henry followed him with his forces, and there negotiated through Matilda of Tuscany, Adelaide, Hugh of Cluny, and others, stood in snow, and was taken back into the church.  Adelaide was one of the guarantors of the conditions agreed upon.  See Gregory’s letter to the German princes, 4.12, Jan.1077:  “At last, overcome by his persistent show of penitence and the ugency of all present, we released him from the bonds of anathema and received him into the grace of Holy Mother Church, accepting from him the guarantees described below, confirmed by the signatures of the abbot of Cluny, of our daughters, the Countess Matilda, and the Countess Adelaide, and other princes, bishops and laymen who seemed to be of service to us.”(3)  Later, in 1080,  Adelaide was persuaded to join Henry’s party.  She did not give him military support when he invaded Italy in 1081, though she did join forces with him in 1082, but she tried mainly to mediate between him and Countess Matilda.(4)  When she accompanied him on one of his attacks on Rome, in 1084, she demanded and secured the release of abbot Benedict of Chiusa whom he had captured on his way to Monte Cassino (Previte-Orton, 249).  \r\nAdelaide’s paternal grandmother, Prangarda, was the daughter of Atto of Canossa; she brought a large dower of land in the counties of Parma and Reggio to the marriage.  Her brother, Tedald, the first marquess of Tuscany of the Canossa line was a grandfather of countess Matilda.  Adelaide was thus a second cousin of Matilda of Tuscany and together they ruled massive territories in northern Italy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","(1)CW Previte Orton, The Early History of the House of Savoy, 1000-1233 (Cambridge:  University Press, 1912), 207.

She did not give him military support when he invaded Italy in 1081, though she did join forces with him in 1082, but she tried mainly to mediate between him and Countess Matilda.(4)  When she accompanied him on one of his attacks on Rome, in 1084, she demanded and secured the release of abbot Benedict of Chiusa whom he had captured on his way to Monte Cassino (Previte-Orton, 249).  \r\nAdelaide’s paternal grandmother, Prangarda, was the daughter of Atto of Canossa; she brought a large dower of land in the counties of Parma and Reggio to the marriage.  Her brother, Tedald, the first marquess of Tuscany of the Canossa line was a grandfather of countess Matilda.  Adelaide was thus a second cousin of Matilda of Tuscany and together they ruled massive territories in northern Italy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (1)CW Previte Orton, The Early History of the House of Savoy, 1000-1233 (Cambridge:  University Press, 1912), 207.

"168","Alix of Vergy","Duchess of Burgundy","(Eudes) III, duke of Burgundy from 1192 to 1218, with whom she had a son and at least two daughters.   Odo was her father’s overlord. The marriage, which took place by 1199, was arranged as a part of the peace between her father and Eudes, who had been engaged in a long conflict.  Hugh had to agree to turn over the chateau of Vergy for two weeks when the duke needed it with free straw for his horses, though he would have to pay for anything else that was taken or broken.   Alix took the castle and land of Vergy into the marriage as her dowry, provided she had a son, otherwise it would come back to her brother,William of Vergy.   The duke gave Vergy various castles and all he had on one side of the Tille river, while Hugh gave up what he had on the other side of the river.  Odo supported Philip Augustus in his struggle with John of England, fighting at Bouvines, and took a large part in the crusade against the Cathars. When Odo died en route to the Holy Land in 1218, their son was five, and Alix became the regent.  The legal age for majority was fourteen, but twenty-one was the effective age (specified in charters)1 and Alix continued to rule the duchy until 1234, after which she continued to confirm and witness donations and settlements, and to buy land to build religious institutions.  Her husband’s will named two of his relatives, his uncle William of Champagne, archbishop of Reims, and his cousin Robert d’Auvergne, bishop of Clermont, as executors and advisors to Alix, but she was the regent, witnessing, overseeing, and making donations, arranging settlements in disputes; she did homage to the French king, Philip Augustus (and later, 1223, to Louis VIII) for the duchy, promising not to remarry without his consent.  At Odo’s death, Alix felt compelled to fullfil his promise to send one hundred knights on crusade, an enormous expense for the duchy.   She had to borrow a considerable amount of money and raise some from taxes, which led to some conflict with the commune of Dijon, resolved by a recognition of their privileges.  But by what E. Petit de Vaisette calls her “good administration and wise economy” (bonne administration et la sage economie,” 4.8)2  during her regency, she was able to discharge the debts, to buy back the lands of Chalon and Beaune which had gone to her husband’s brother, the Dauphin of Viennois, to buy the seigneury of Salins in the heart of Jura (Richard, 55)3 and to pass the duchy to her son in a strong state, the beginning of a prosperity hitherto unknown to the dukes of Burgundy (Petit de Vaisette, “prosperite inconnu jusque-la` aux ducs de Bourgogne”).    In some cases she extended privileges to help pay her purchases, in others she profited from others’ conflicts to gain territory without battle or payment (Petit de Vaisette, 4.24); according to Garnier, 104, she was sympathetic to communal freedom, according to Plancher,391, she kept peace between her subjects.4  She ruled Burgundy until Hugh IV reached his majority, after which she continued to confirm and witness donations and settlements, and to buy land to build religious institutions.  Her seal, which is pictured in Petit de Vaisette, 4.208, shows a woman sitting side-saddle on a horse holding a bird on her fist, is sometimes appended to charters she witnesses, at the request of the participants (see 4.228, #1865, 1227, June). Alix has been erroneously connected with the vengeful duchess portrayed in the Chastelaine de Vergi, but the editor of the roman, Gaston Raynaud, insists that neither of Alix’s two nieces could have been inspirations for the roman, and suggests a later niece of Hugh IV and his duchess as the protagonists, if indeed there is any historical source for the story.5  Most, though not all, of the letters cited here come from Petit de Vaisette, but in some cases, he summarizes rather than transcribes them.

"30","Melisende, queen of Jerusalem","queen of Jerusalem","Melisend of Jerusalem was the daughter of Baldwin II, king of Jerusalem and Morphia of Melitene, an Armenian princess.  Melisende was the oldest of four daughters; the others were Alice, princess of Antioch, Hodierna, countess of Tripoli, and Joveta, abbess of  St. Lazarus at Bethany,  founded by Melisende.  Melisende was married to Fulk V, count of Anjou (the father of Geoffrey who married Empress Matilda, and thus the grandfather of Henry II of England).  Fulk and Melisende had two sons who survived, Baldwin III and Amalric/Amaury I, who succeeded his brother.  Although the marriage arrangement had made Fulk the heir to the throne, Baldwin II had acknowledged Melisende as his heir and when he died in 1131, he conferred the care of the kingdom and full power over it jointly to Fulk, Melisende and their son Baldwin, then two years old. 1. Fulk and Melisende were crowned together, but Fulk attempted to rule alone and accused his wife of an affair with a cousin, Hugh of Le Puiset.  The affair was never proved, contemporaries like William of Tyre did not believe it, and Melisende had the support of local nobles against Fulk and the Franks.   When an attempt was made on Hugh’s life, Fulk was blamed and was then obliged to reconcile with Melisende and to rule with her.   His subsequent charters, from 1134, include her consent; Baldwin’s consent is included from 1138 when he was 8 or 9.  (For the formulas of consent, see below.)  Fulk died as the result of a hunting accident in 1143, leaving Melisende as queen and co-ruler with Baldwin III.  They  were crowned together , but she controlled the government; charters were issued jointly, but she apparently made the decisions, according to William of Tyre.   (A gift made by Raymond, count of Tripoli, is made with the consent of king Baldwin III and queen Melisende, RRH #236,  1145)2.   Melisende gave lavishly to the church and brought her younger son in to witness charters, all to bolster her power;  she established power bases in the center and south of the country, controlling the land from Galilee to Judaea.  There was tension between Melisende and Baldwin as he attempted to assert his authority, but when he was involved in a failed expedition against Damascus in 1148, he  lost ground and she issued charters alone or in her name with his consent.   She had her own administrative machinery as well as nobles loyal to her and when Baldwin summoned the barons to march on Antioch in 1150, hers did not go, which amounted to declaring a division of the country.  The division was made official, with Melisende taking Nablus and Jerusalem, Baldwin Acre and Tyre,  which she “grants” from her heritage.  Baldwin claimed he needs more resources for the country and marched on Jerusalem in 1152.  Melisende by then had lost much of her support, had to surrender, and was given Nablus as a kind of dowry, with her authority reduced to that of a local lord.  She died on September 11, 1161.  She had founded and endowed a number of religious institutions and was the recipient of the Melisende Psalter.   \r\nThe charters enacted during Fulk’s reign were presumably initiated by him, so those with Melisende’s consent are briefly listed here.

Her grandfather, Guillaume IX of Aquitaine/VII of Poitou, was the first known Provençal poet and Eleanor brought that rich cultural heritage as well as the rich western territories of Aquitaine and Poitou to both her marriages.  Though she was married young and did not rule her lands independent of a husband, she served as regent intermittently for both husband and sons through a long and active life.(1)  In her first marriage, Eleanor and the king of France had two daughters, Marie countess of Champagne, and Alix countess of Chartres and Blois; in her second marriage with the king of England, she had five sons and three daughters:  William (1153), Henry (1155), Matilda (1156) duchess of Saxony, Richard (1157), Geoffrey (1158), Eleanor (1161) queen of Castile, Joanna (1165) queen of Sicily and countess of Toulouse, John (1166).  From her own and her children’s marriages, she was related to many of the ruling houses of Europe. When her first marriage ended in divorce in March 1152, Eleanor eluded other suitors and sent to the husband she chose, Henry, eleven years her junior, whom she married in May 1152.  She served as regent for Henry in the early years of their marriage, while she was giving birth to their children, and took active control of Aquitaine in 1168, but her involvement in her sons’ revolts against their father led to her imprisonment in 1174, and it was not until Henry’s death in 1189 that she again took an active public part in the political lives of her remaining sons, Richard and John, and in negotiations for royal marriages, though she had assumed nominal control of Aquitaine from Richard in 1185. When Richard was captured by Leopold V of Austria on his return from crusade in 1193, Eleanor pressed others to work for his release and raised the ransom to free him while she exercised direct authority in the kingdom.(2)  She continued to involve herself in public affairs from his release in 1194 to his death in 1199, the year she retired to the monastery of Fontevrault, “that citadel of feminine authority” (Brown, 12), but even from there she took action:  she recognized Philip Augustus, king of France, as overlord of Poitou, and in turn received her son John as her vassal for the land; and she led mercenaries to Anjou to support John against adherents of her grandson Arthur.
